      An electric vehicle (EV) is a vehicle that uses one or more
      <strong>electric motors for propulsion</strong>. The vehicle can be
      powered by a collector system, with electricity from extravehicular
      sources, or can be powered autonomously by a battery or by converting fuel
      to electricity using a generator or fuel cells.[1] EVs include road and
      <strong>rail vehicles, electric boats </strong>and
      <strong>underwater vessels, electric aircraft</strong> and electric
      spacecraft. Early electric vehicles first came into existence in the late
      19th century, when the
      <strong>Second Industrial Revolution</strong> brought forth
      electrification. Using electricity was among the preferred methods for
      motor vehicle propulsion as it provides a level of quietness, comfort and
      ease of operation that could not be achieved by the gasoline engine cars
      of the time, but range anxiety due to the limited energy storage offered
      by
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle"
        >contemporary battery technologies</a
      >
      hindered any mass adoption of private electric vehicles throughout the
      20th century. Internal combustion engines (both gasoline and diesel
      engines) were the dominant propulsion mechanisms for cars and trucks for
      about 100 years, but electricity-powered locomotion remained commonplace
      in other vehicle types, such as overhead line-powered mass transit
      vehicles like <strong>electric trains, trams, monorails</strong> and
      trolley buses, as well as various small, low-speed, short-range
      battery-powered personal vehicles such as mobility scooters.

      <strong> Hybrid electric vehicles</strong>, where electric motors are used
      as a supplementary propulsion to internal combustion engines, became more
      widespread in the late 1990s. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, where
      electric motors can be used as the predominant propulsion rather than a
      supplement, did not see any mass production until the late 2000s, and
      battery electric cars did not become practical options for the consumer
      market until the 2010s. Progress in batteries, electric motors and power
      electronics have made electric cars more feasible than during the 20th
      century. As a means of reducing tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide and
      other pollutants, and to reduce use of fossil fuels, government incentives
      are available in many areas to promote the adoption of electric cars and
      trucks.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr />

    <p>
      Electric motive power started in 1827 when Hungarian priest Ányos Jedlik
      built the first crude but viable electric motor; the next year he used it
      to power a small model car. In 1835, Professor Sibrandus Stratingh of the
      University of Groningen, in the Netherlands, built a small-scale electric
      car, and sometime between 1832 and 1839,
      <strong>Robert Anderson of Scotland</strong> invented the first crude
      electric carriage, powered by non-rechargeable primary cells. American
      blacksmith and inventor
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle"
        >Thomas Davenport </a
      >built a toy electric locomotive, powered by a primitive electric motor,
      in 1835. In 1838, a Scotsman named Robert Davidson built an electric
      locomotive that attained a speed of four miles per hour (6 km/h). In
      England, a patent was granted in 1840 for the use of rails as conductors
      of electric current, and similar American patents were issued to Lilley
      and Colten in 1847. The first mass-produced electric vehicles appeared in
      America in the early 1900s. In 1902, the Studebaker Automobile Company
      entered the automotive business with electric vehicles, though it also
      entered the gasoline vehicles market in 1904. However, with the advent of
      cheap assembly line cars by Ford Motor Company, the popularity of electric
      cars declined significantly. Due to lack of electricity grids and the
      limitations of storage batteries at that time, electric cars did not gain
      much popularity; however, electric trains gained immense popularity due to
      their economies and achievable speeds. By the 20th century, electric rail
      transport became commonplace due to advances in the development of
      electric locomotives. Over time their general-purpose commercial use
      reduced to specialist roles as platform trucks, forklift trucks,
      ambulances, tow tractors, and urban delivery vehicles, such as the iconic
      British milk float. For most of the 20th century, the UK was the world's
      largest user of electric road vehicles. Electrified trains were used for
      coal transport, as the motors did not use the valuable oxygen in the
      mines. Switzerland's lack of natural fossil resources forced the rapid
      electrification of their rail network. One of the earliest rechargeable
      batteries – the nickel-iron battery – was favored by Edison for use in
      electric cars. EVs were among the earliest automobiles, and before the
      preeminence of light, powerful internal combustion engines (ICEs),
      electric automobiles held many vehicle land speed and distance records in
      the early 1900s. They were produced by Baker Electric, Columbia Electric,
      Detroit Electric, and others, and at one point in history outsold
      gasoline-powered vehicles. In 1900, 28 percent of the cars on the road in
      the US were electric. EVs were so popular that even President Woodrow
      Wilson and his secret service agents toured Washington, D.C., in their
      Milburn Electrics, which covered 60–70 miles (100–110 km) per charge. Most
      producers of passenger cars opted for gasoline cars in the first decade of
      the 20th century, but electric trucks were an established niche well into
      the 1920s.A number of developments contributed to a decline in the
      popularity of electric cars Improved road infrastructure required a
      greater range than that offered by electric cars, and the discovery of
      large reserves of petroleum in Texas, Oklahoma, and California led to the
      wide availability of affordable gasoline/petrol, making internal
      combustion powered cars cheaper to operate over long distances. Electric
      vehicles were seldom marketed as a women's luxury car, which may have been
      a stigma among male consumers. Also, internal combustion powered cars
      became ever-easier to operate thanks to the invention of the electric
      starter by Charles Kettering in 1912, which eliminated the need of a hand
      crank for starting a gasoline engine, and the noise emitted by ICE cars
      became more bearable thanks to the use of the muffler, which Hiram Percy
      Maxim had invented in 1897. As roads were improved outside urban areas,
      electric vehicle range could not compete with the ICE. Finally, the
      initiation of mass production of gasoline-powered vehicles by Henry Ford
      in 1913 reduced significantly the cost of gasoline cars as compared to
      electric cars. In the 1930s, National City Lines, which was a partnership
      of General Motors, Firestone, and Standard Oil of California purchased
      many electric tram networks across the country to dismantle them and
      replace them with GM buses. The partnership was convicted of conspiring to
      monopolize the sale of equipment and supplies to their subsidiary
      companies, but was acquitted of conspiring to monopolize the provision of
      transportation services. The <strong>Copenhagen Summit</strong>, which was
      conducted in the midst of a severe observable climate change brought on by
      human-made greenhouse gas emissions, was held in 2009. During the summit,
      more than 70 countries developed plans to eventually reach net zero. For
      many countries, adopting more EVs will help reduce the use of gasoline.

    <h3><strong>Experimentation</strong></h3>

    <p>
      In January 1990, General Motors President introduced its EV concept
      two-seater, the "Impact", at the Los Angeles Auto Show. That September,
      the <strong>California Air Resources Board</strong> mandated
      major-automaker sales of EVs, in phases starting in 1998. From 1996 to
      1998 GM produced 1117 EV1s, 800 of which were made available through
      three-year leases. Chrysler, Ford, GM, Honda, and Toyota also produced
      limited numbers of EVs for California drivers during this time period. In
      2003, upon the expiration of GM's EV1 leases, GM discontinued them. The
      discontinuation has variously been attributed to: 1.The auto industry's
      successful federal court challenge to California's zero-emissions vehicle
      mandate, 2.A federal regulation requiring GM to produce and maintain spare
      parts for the few thousand EV1s and 3.The success of the oil and auto
      industries' media campaign to reduce public acceptance of EVs. A movie
      made on the subject in 2005–2006 was titled Who Killed the Electric Car?
      and released theatrically by Sony Pictures Classics in 2006. The film
      explores the roles of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle">
        automobile manufacturers, oil industry</a
      >, the U.S. government, batteries, hydrogen vehicles, and the general
      public, and each of their roles in limiting the deployment and adoption of
      this technology. Ford released a number of their Ford Ecostar delivery
      vans into the market. Honda, Nissan and Toyota also repossessed and
      crushed most of their EVs, which, like the GM EV1s, had been available
      only by closed-end lease. After public protests, Toyota sold 200 of its
      RAV4 EVs; they later sold at over their original forty-thousand-dollar
      price. Later, BMW of Canada sold off a number of Mini EVs when their
      Canadian testing ended. The production of the
      <strong>Citroën Berlingo Electrique</strong> stopped in September 2005.
      Zenn started production in 2006 but ended by 2009.

    <h3><strong>Reintroduction</strong></h3>

    <p>
      During the late 20th and early 21st century, the
      <strong>environmental impact</strong> of the petroleum-based
      transportation infrastructure, along with the fear of peak oil, led to
      renewed interest in electric transportation infrastructure. EVs differ
      from fossil fuel-powered vehicles in that the electricity they consume can
      be generated from a wide range of sources, including fossil fuels, nuclear
      power, and renewables such as solar power and wind power, or any
      combination of those. The carbon footprint and other emissions of electric
      vehicles vary depending on the fuel and technology used for electricity
      generation. The electricity may be stored in the vehicle using a battery,
      flywheel, or supercapacitors. Vehicles using internal combustion engines
      usually only derive their energy from a single or a few sources, usually
      non-renewable fossil fuels. A key advantage of electric vehicles is
      regenerative braking, which recovers kinetic energy, typically lost during
      friction braking as heat, as electricity restored to the on-board battery.
    </p>

    <h2>Electricity sources</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      There are many ways to generate electricity, of varying costs, efficiency
      and ecological desirability.
    </p>

    <h3><strong>Connection to generator plants</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Direct connection to electric grids as is common among electric trains,
      trams, trolleybuses, and trolleytrucks

      <strong
        ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle">
          Online electric vehicle</a
        >
      </strong>
      power from electric power strips buried under the road surface through
      electromagnetic induction.
    </p>

    <h3><strong>Onboard generators and hybrid EVs</strong></h3>

    <p>
      Generated on-board using a diesel engine: diesel–electric locomotive and
      diesel–electric multiple unit (DEMU) Generated on-board using a fuel cell:
      fuel cell vehicle Generated on-board using nuclear energy: nuclear
      submarines and aircraft carriers Renewable sources such as solar power:
      solar vehicle It is also possible to have hybrid EVs that derive
      electricity from multiple sources, such as: On-board rechargeable
      electricity storage system (RESS) and a direct continuous connection to
      land-based generation plants for purposes of on-highway recharging with
      unrestricted highway range[25] On-board rechargeable electricity storage
      system and a fueled propulsion power source (internal combustion engine):
      plug-in hybrid For especially large EVs, such as submarines, the chemical
      energy of the diesel–electric can be replaced by a nuclear reactor. The
      nuclear reactor usually provides heat, which drives a steam turbine, which
      drives a generator, which is then fed to the propulsion. See Nuclear
      marine propulsion. A few experimental vehicles, such as some cars and a
      handful of aircraft use solar panels for electricity.
    </p>

    <h3><strong>Onboard storage</strong></h3>

    <p>
      systems are powered from an external generator plant (nearly always when
      stationary), and then disconnected before motion occurs, and the
      electricity is stored in the vehicle until needed. Full Electric Vehicles
      (FEV). Power storage methods include: Chemical energy stored on the
      vehicle in on-board batteries: Battery electric vehicle (BEV) typically
      with a lithium-ion battery Kinetic energy storage: flywheels Static energy
      stored on the vehicle in on-board electric double-layer capacitors
      Batteries, <strong>electric double-layer</strong> capacitors and flywheel
      energy storage are forms of rechargeable on-board electricity storage
      systems. By avoiding an intermediate mechanical step, the energy
      conversion efficiency can be improved compared to hybrids by avoiding
      unnecessary energy conversions. Furthermore, electro-chemical batteries
      conversions are reversible, allowing electrical energy to be stored in
      chemical form.
    </p>

    <h2>Lithium-ion battery</h2>
    <hr />

    <p>
      Most electric vehicles use lithium-ion batteries (Li-Ions or LIBs).
      Lithium-ion batteries have a higher energy density, longer life span, and
      higher power density than most other practical batteries. Complicating
      factors include safety, durability, thermal breakdown,<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle"
      >
        environmental impact</a
      >, and cost. Li-ion batteries should be used within safe temperature and
      voltage ranges to operate safely and efficiently. Increasing the battery's
      lifespan decreases effective costs and environmental impact. One technique
      is to operate a subset of the battery cells at a time and switching these
      subsets. In the past, nickel–metal hydride batteries were used in some
      electric cars, such as those made by General Motors. These battery types
      are considered outdated due to their tendencies to self-discharge in the
      heat. Furthermore, a patent for this type of battery was held by Chevron,
      which created a problem for their widespread development. These factors,
      coupled with their high cost, has led to lithium-ion batteries leading as
      the predominant battery for EVs. The prices of lithium-ion batteries have
      declined dramatically over the past decade, contributing to a reduction in
      price for electric vehicles, but an increase in the price of critical
      minerals such as lithium from 2021 to the end of 2022 has put pressure on
      historical battery price decreases.
    </p>

    <h2>Electric motor</h2>
    <hr />

    <p>
      The power of a vehicle's electric motor, as in other machines, is measured
      in kilowatts (kW). Electric motors can deliver their maximum torque over a
      wide RPM range. This means that the performance of a vehicle with a 100 kW
      electric motor exceeds that of a vehicle with a 100 kW internal combustion
      engine, which can only deliver its maximum torque within a limited range
      of engine speed. Efficiency of charging varies considerably depending on
      the type of charger, and energy is lost during the process of converting
      the electrical energy to mechanical energy. Usually, direct current (DC)
      electricity is fed into a DC/AC inverter where it is converted to
      alternating current (AC) electricity and this AC electricity is connected
      to a 3-phase AC motor. For electric trains, forklift trucks, and some
      electric cars, DC motors are often used. In some cases, universal motors
      are used, and then AC or DC may be employed. In recent production
      vehicles, various motor types have been implemented; for instance,
      induction motors within Tesla Motor vehicles and permanent magnet machines
      in the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Bolt.
    </p>

    <h2>Energy and motors</h2>
    <hr />

    <p>
      Most large electric transport systems are powered by stationary sources of
      electricity that are directly connected to the vehicles through wires.
      Electric traction allows the use of regenerative braking, in which the
      motors are used as brakes and become generators that transform the motion
      of, usually, a train into electrical power that is then fed back into the
      lines. This system is particularly advantageous in mountainous operations,
      as descending vehicles can produce a large portion of the power required
      for those ascending. This regenerative system is only viable if the system
      is large enough to use the power generated by descending vehicles. In the
      systems above, motion is provided by a rotary electric motor. However, it
      is possible to "unroll" the motor to drive directly against a special
      matched track. These linear motors are used in maglev trains which float
      above the rails supported by magnetic levitation. This allows for almost
      no rolling resistance of the vehicle and no mechanical wear and tear of
      the train or track. In addition to the high-performance control systems
      needed, switching and curving of the tracks becomes difficult with linear
      motors, which to date has restricted their operations to high-speed point
      to point services.
    </p>

    <h3>Vehicle types</h3>
    <hr />

    <p>
      It is generally possible to equip any kind of vehicle with an electric
      power-train.
    </p>

    <h4>Ground vehicles</h4>
    <h5>Pure-electric vehicles</h5>

    <p>
      A pure-electric vehicle or all-electric vehicle is powered exclusively
      through electric motors. The electricity may come from a battery (battery
      electric vehicle), solar panel (solar vehicle) or fuel cell (fuel cell
      vehicle).
    </p>

    <h4>Hybrid EVs</h4>

    <p>
      A hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) is a type of hybrid vehicle that combines
      a conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) system with an electric
      propulsion system (hybrid vehicle drivetrain). The presence of the
      electric powertrain is intended to achieve either better fuel economy than
      a conventional vehicle or better performance. There is a variety of HEV
      types and the degree to which each functions as an electric vehicle (EV)
      also varies. The most common form of HEV is the hybrid electric car,
      although hybrid electric trucks (pickups and tractors), buses, boats, and
      aircraft also exist. Modern HEVs make use of efficiency-improving
      technologies such as regenerative brakes which convert the vehicle's
      kinetic energy to electric energy, which is stored in a battery or
      supercapacitor. Some varieties of HEV use an internal combustion engine to
      turn an electrical generator, which either recharges the vehicle's
      batteries or directly powers its electric drive motors; this combination
      is known as a motor–generator. Many HEVs reduce idle emissions by shutting
      down the engine at idle and restarting it when needed; this is known as a
      start-stop system. A hybrid-electric produces lower tailpipe emissions
      than a comparably sized gasoline car since the hybrid's gasoline engine is
      usually smaller than that of a gasoline-powered vehicle. If the engine is
      not used to drive the car directly, it can be geared to run at maximum
      efficiency, further improving fuel economy. There are different ways that
      a hybrid electric vehicle can combine the power from an electric motor and
      the internal combustion engine. The most common type is a parallel hybrid
      that connects the engine and the electric motor to the wheels through
      mechanical coupling. In this scenario, the electric motor and the engine
      can drive the wheels directly. Series hybrids only use the electric motor
      to drive the wheels and can often be referred to as extended-range
      electric vehicles (EREVs) or range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs).
      There are also series-parallel hybrids where the vehicle can be powered by
      the engine working alone, the electric motor on its own, or by both
      working together; this is designed so that the engine can run at its
      optimum range as often as possible.
    </p>

    <h4>Plug-in electric vehicle</h4>

    <p>
      A plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) is any motor vehicle that can be
      recharged from any external source of electricity, such as wall sockets,
      and the electricity stored in the Rechargeable battery packs drives or
      contributes to drive the wheels. PEV is a subcategory of electric vehicles
      that includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles,
      (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and
      conventional internal combustion engine vehicles.
    </p>

    <h4>Range-extended electric vehicle</h4>

    <p>
      A range-extended electric vehicle (REEV) is a vehicle powered by an
      electric motor and a plug-in battery. An auxiliary combustion engine is
      used only to supplement battery charging and not as the primary source of
      power.
    </p>

    <h4>Space rover vehicles</h4>

    <p>
      Crewed and uncrewed vehicles have been used to explore the Moon and other
      planets in the Solar System. On the last three missions of the Apollo
      program in 1971 and 1972, astronauts drove silver-oxide battery-powered
      Lunar Roving Vehicles distances up to 35.7 kilometers (22.2 mi) on the
      lunar surface. Uncrewed, solar-powered rovers have explored the Moon and
      Mars.

    </p>

    <h3>Properties</h3>
    <h4>Components</h4>
    <p>
      The type of battery, the type of traction motor and the motor controller
      design vary according to the size, power and proposed application, which
      can be as small as a <strong>motorized shopping cart</strong> or
      wheelchair, through pedelecs, electric motorcycles and scooters,
      neighborhood electric vehicles, industrial fork-lift trucks and including
      many hybrid vehicles.
    </p>

    <h4>Energy sources</h4>
    <p>
      EVs are much more efficient than fossil fuel vehicles and have few direct
      emissions. At the same time, they do rely on electrical energy that is
      generally provided by a combination of non-fossil fuel plants and fossil
      fuel plants. Consequently, EVs can be made less polluting overall by
      modifying the source of electricity. In some areas, persons can ask
      utilities to provide their electricity from renewable energy. Fossil fuel
      vehicle efficiency and pollution standards take years to filter through a
      nation's fleet of vehicles. New efficiency and pollution standards rely on
      the purchase of new vehicles, often as the current vehicles already on the
      road reach their end-of-life. Only a few nations set a retirement age for
      old vehicles, such as Japan or Singapore, forcing periodic upgrading of
      all vehicles already on the road.
    </p>

    <h4>Batteries</h4>

    <p>
      An electric-vehicle battery (EVB) in addition to the traction battery
      specialty systems used for industrial (or recreational) vehicles, are
      batteries used to power the propulsion system of a battery electric
      vehicle (BEVs). These batteries are usually a secondary (rechargeable)
      battery, and are typically lithium-ion batteries. Traction batteries,
      specifically designed with a high ampere-hour capacity, are used in
      forklifts, electric golf carts, riding floor scrubbers, electric
      motorcycles, electric cars, trucks, vans, and other electric vehicles.
    </p>

    <h4>Charging</h4>
    <h5>Grid capacity</h5>
    If almost all road vehicles were electric it would increase global demand
    for electricity by up to 25% by 2050 compared to 2020.[need quotation to
    verify] However, overall energy consumption and emissions would diminish
    because of the higher efficiency of EVs over the entire cycle, and th
    reduction in energy needed to refine fossil fuels.

    <h5>Charging stations</h5>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle"
        >charging station</a
      >, also known as a charge point, chargepoint, or electric vehicle supply
      equipment (EVSE), is a power supply device that supplies electrical power
      for recharging plug-in electric vehicles (including battery electric
      vehicles, electric trucks, electric buses, neighborhood electric vehicles
      and plug-in hybrid vehicles). There are two main types of EV chargers:
      Alternating current (AC) charging stations and direct current (DC)
      charging stations. Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by
      direct current electricity, while most mains electricity is delivered from
      the power grid as alternating current. For this reason, most electric
      vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the "onboard
      charger" (OBC). At an AC charging station, AC power from the grid is
      supplied to this onboard charger, which converts it into DC power to then
      recharge the battery. DC chargers provide higher power charging (which
      requires much larger AC-to-DC converters) by building the converter into
      the charging station instead of the vehicle to avoid size and weight
      restrictions. The station then supplies DC power to the vehicle directly,
      bypassing the onboard converter. Most modern electric car models can
      accept both AC and DC power. Charging stations provide connectors that
      conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are
      commonly equipped with multiple connectors to be able to charge a wide
      variety of vehicles that use competing standards. Public charging stations
      are typically found street-side or at retail shopping centers, government
      facilities, and other parking areas. Private charging stations are
      typically found at residences, workplaces, and hotels.
    </p>

    <h5>Battery swapping</h5>

    <p>
      Instead of recharging EVs from electric sockets, batteries could be
      mechanically replaced at special stations in a few minutes (battery
      swapping). Batteries with greater energy density such as metal-air fuel
      cells cannot always be recharged in a purely electric way, so some form of
      mechanical recharge may be used instead. A zinc–air battery, technically a
      fuel cell, is difficult to recharge electrically so may be "refueled" by
      periodically replacing the anode or electrolyte instead.
    </p>

    <h5>Dynamic charging</h5>

    <p>
      TRL (formerly Transport Research Laboratory) lists three power delivery
      types for dynamic charging, or charging while the vehicle is in motion:
      overhead power lines, and ground level power through rail or induction.
      TRL lists overhead power as the most technologically mature solution which
      provides the highest levels of power, but the technology is unsuitable for
      non-commercial vehicles. Ground-level power is suitable for all vehicles,
      with rail being a mature solution with high transfer of power and easily
      accessible and inspected elements. Inductive charging delivers the least
      power and requires more roadside equipment than the alternatives. The
      European Commission published in 2021 a request for regulation and
      standardization of electric road systems. Shortly afterward, a working
      group of the French Ministry of Ecology recommended adopting a European
      electric road standard formulated with Sweden, Germany, Italy, the
      Netherlands, Spain, Poland, and others. The first standard for electrical
      equipment on-board a vehicle powered by a rail electric road system (ERS),
      CENELEC Technical Standard 50717, has been approved in late 2022.
      Following standards, encompassing "full interoperability" and a "unified
      and interoperable solution" for ground-level power supply, are scheduled
      to be published by the end 2024, detailing complete "specifications for
      communication and power supply through conductive rails embedded in the
      road".
    </p>

    <h3>Other in-development technologies</h3>
    <p>
      Conventional electric double-layer capacitors are being worked on to
      achieve the energy density of lithium-ion batteries, offering almost
      unlimited lifespans and no environmental issues. High-K electric
      double-layer capacitors, such as EEStor's EESU, could improve lithium ion
      energy density several times over if they can be produced. Lithium-sulphur
      batteries offer 250 Wh/kg. Sodium-ion batteries promise 400 Wh/kg with
      only minimal expansion/contraction during charge/discharge and a very high
      surface area, and rely on lower cost materials than Lithium-ion, Leading
      to Cheaper batteries that do not require critical minerals.
    </p>

    <h4>Safety</h4>

    <p>
      The United Nations in Geneva (UNECE) has adopted the first international
      regulation (Regulation 100) on safety of both fully electric and hybrid
      electric cars, with the intent of ensuring that cars with a high voltage
      electric power train, such as hybrid and fully-electric vehicles, are as
      safe as combustion-powered cars. The EU and Japan have already indicated
      that they intend to incorporate the new UNECE Regulation in their
      respective rules on technical standards for vehicles.
    </p>

    <h4>Environmental</h4>

    <p>
      EVs release no tailpipe air pollutants, and reduce respiratory illnesses
      such as asthma. However, EVs are charged with electricity that may be
      generated by means that have health and environmental impacts. The carbon
      emissions from producing and operating an EV are in the majority of cases
      less than those of producing and operating a conventional vehicle. EVs in
      urban areas almost always pollute less than internal combustion vehicles.
      One limitation of the environmental potential of EVs is that simply
      switching the existing privately owned car fleet from ICEs to EVs will not
      free up road space for active travel or public transport. Electric
      micromobility vehicles, such as e-bikes, may contribute to the
      decarbonisation of transport systems, especially outside of urban areas
      which are already well-served by public transport. Internal combustion
      engined vehicles use far more raw materials over their lifetime than EVs.
    </p>

    <h5>Lithium-ion batteries</h5>

    <p>
      Since their first commercial release in 1991, lithium-ion batteries have
      become an important technology for achieving low-carbon transportation
      systems. Information regarding the sustainability of production process of
      batteries has become a politically charged topic.[obsolete source]
      Business processes of raw material extraction in practice raise issues of
      transparency and accountability of the management of extractive resources.
      In the complex supply chain of lithium technology, there are diverse
      stakeholders representing corporate interests, public interest groups and
      political elites that are concerned with outcomes from the technology
      production and use. One possibility to achieve balanced extractive
      processes would be the establishment of commonly agreed standards on the
      governance of technology worldwide. The compliance of these standards can
      be assessed by the Assessment of Sustainability in Supply Chains
      Frameworks (ASSC). Hereby, the qualitative assessment consists of
      examining governance and social and environmental commitment. Indicators
      for the quantitative assessment are management systems and standards,
      compliance and social and environmental indicators. One source estimates
      that over a fifth of the lithium and about 65% of the cobalt needed for
      electric cars will be from recycled sources by 2035.[101] On the other
      hand, when counting the large quantities of fossil fuel non-electric cars
      consume over their lifetime, electric cars can be considered to
      dramatically reduce raw-material needs. In 2022, the manufacturing of an
      EV emitted on average around 50% more CO2 than an equivalent internal
      combustion engine vehicle, but this difference is more than offset by the
      much higher emissions from the oil used in driving an internal combustion
      engine Vehicle over its lifetime compared to those from generating the
      electricity used for driving the EV. In 2023, Greenpeace issued a video
      criticizing the view that EVs are "silver bullet for climate", arguing
      that the construction phase has a high environmental impact. For example,
      the rise in SUV sales by Hyundai almost eliminate the climate benefits of
      passing to EV in this company, because even electric SUVs have a high
      carbon footprint as they consume much raw materials and energy during
      construction. Greenpeace proposes a mobility as a service concept instead,
      based on biking, public transport and ride sharing.

    <h4>Socio-economic</h4>
    <p>
      A 2003 study in the United Kingdom found that "pollution is most
      concentrated in areas where young children and their parents are more
      likely to live and least concentrated in areas to which the elderly tend
      to migrate," and that "those communities that are most polluted and which
      also emit the least pollution tend to be amongst the poorest in Britain."
      A 2019 UK study found that "households in the poorest areas emit the least
      NOx and PM, whilst the least poor areas emitted the highest, per km,
      vehicle emissions per household through having higher vehicle ownership,
      owning more diesel vehicles and driving further."
    </p>

    <h4>Mechanical</h4>

    <p>
      Electric motors are mechanically very simple and often achieve 90%
      <strong>energy conversion efficiency</strong> over the full range of
      speeds and power output and can be precisely controlled. They can also be
      combined with regenerative braking systems that have the ability to
      convert movement energy back into stored electricity. This can be used to
      reduce the wear on brake systems (and consequent brake pad dust) and
      reduce the total energy requirement of a trip. Regenerative braking is
      especially effective for start-and-stop city use. They can be finely
      controlled and provide high torque from stationary-to-moving, unlike
      internal combustion engines, and do not need multiple gears to match power
      curves. This removes the need for gearboxes and torque converters. EVs
      provide quiet and smooth operation and consequently have less noise and
      vibration than internal combustion engines. While this is a desirable
      attribute, it has also evoked concern that the absence of the usual sounds
      of an approaching vehicle poses a danger to blind, elderly and very young
      pedestrians. To mitigate this situation, many countries mandate warning
      sounds when EVs are moving slowly, up to a speed when normal motion and
      rotation (road, suspension, electric motor, etc.) noises become audible.
      Electric motors do not require oxygen, unlike internal combustion engines;
      this is useful for submarines and for space rovers.
    </p>

    <h4>Energy resilience</h4>
    <p>
      can be produced from a variety of sources; therefore, it gives the
      greatest degree of energy resilience.
    </p>

    <h4>Energy efficiency</h4>
    <p>
      EV 'tank-to-wheels' efficiency is about a factor of three higher than
      internal combustion engine vehicles.[107] Energy is not consumed while the
      vehicle is stationary, unlike internal combustion engines which consume
      fuel while idling. In 2022, EVs enabled a net reduction of about 80 Mt of
      GHG emissions, on a well to-wheels basis, and the net GHG benefit of EVs
      will increase over time as the electricity sector is decarbonised.
      Well-to-wheel efficiency of an EV has less to do with the vehicle itself
      and more to do with the method of electricity production. A particular EV
      would instantly become twice as efficient if electricity production were
      switched from fossil fuels to renewable energy, such as wind power, tidal
      power, solar power, and nuclear power. Thus, when "well-to-wheels" is
      cited, the discussion is no longer about the vehicle, but rather about the
      entire energy supply infrastructure – in the case of fossil fuels this
      should also include energy spent on exploration, mining, refining, and
      distribution.[citation needed] The lifecycle analysis of EVs shows that
      even when powered by the most carbon-intensive electricity in Europe, they
      emit less greenhouse gases than a conventional diesel vehicle.
    </p>

    <h4>Total cost</h4>
    <p>
      As of 2021 the purchase price of an EV is often more, but the total cost
      of ownership of an EV varies wildly depending on location[111] and
      distance travelled per year in parts of the world where fossil fuels are
      subsidized, lifecycle costs of diesel or gas-powered vehicle are sometimes
      less than a comparable EV. European carmakers face significant pressure
      from more affordable Chinese models and price cuts by US-based Tesla
      Motor. From 2021 to 2022, the European market share of Chinese EV
      manufacturers doubled to almost 9%, prompting the CEO of Stellantis to
      describe it as an "invasion".
    </p>

    <h4>Range</h4>

    <p>
      Electric vehicles may have shorter range compared to vehicles with
      internal combustion engines,[115][116] which is why the electrification of
      long-distance transport, such as long-distance shipping, remains
      challenging. In 2022, the sales-weighted average range of small BEVs sold
      in the United States was nearly 350 km, while in France, Germany and the
      United Kingdom it was just under 300 km, compared to under 220 km in
      China.
    </p>

    <h4>Heating of EVs</h4>
    <p>
      Well insulated cabins can heat the vehicle using the body heat of the
      passengers. This is not enough, however, in colder climates as a driver
      delivers only about 100 W of heating power. A heat pump system, capable of
      cooling the cabin during summer and heating it during winter, is an
      efficient way of heating and cooling EVs. For vehicles which are connected
      to the grid, battery EVs can be preheated, or cooled, with little or no
      need for battery energy, especially for short trips. Most new electric
      cars come with heat pumps as standard.
    </p>

    <h3>Electric public transit efficiency</h3>

    <p>
      Shifts from private to public transport (train,
      <strong>trolleybus, personal rapid transit</strong> or tram) have the
      potential for large gains in efficiency in terms of an individual's
      distance traveled per kWh. Research shows people prefer trams to buses,
      because they are quieter and more comfortable and perceived as having
      higher status. Therefore, it may be possible to cut liquid fossil fuel
      consumption in cities through the use of electric trams. Trams may be the
      most energy-efficient form of public transportation, with rubber-wheeled
      vehicles using two-thirds more energy than the equivalent tram, and run on
      electricity rather than fossil fuels. In terms of net present value, they
      are also the cheapest – Blackpool trams are still running after 100 years,
      but combustion buses only last about 15 years.
    </p>

    <h3>Accident rate</h3>
    <p>
      Research published in the British Medical Journal indicates that electric
      cars kill pedestrians at twice the rate of petrol or diesel vehicles.
    </p>

    <h3>Government incentivization</h3>

    The IEA suggests that taxing inefficient internal combustion engine vehicles
    could encourage adoption of EVs, with taxes raised being used to fund
    subsidies for EVs.[87] Government procurement is sometimes used to encourage
    national EV manufacturers.[123][124] Many countries will
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle"
      >ban sales of fossil fuel vehicles</a
    >
    between 2025 and 2040.[125] Many governments offer incentives to promote the
    use of electric vehicles, with the goals of reducing air pollution and oil
    consumption. Some incentives intend to increase purchases of electric
    vehicles by offsetting the purchase price with a grant. Other incentives
    include lower tax rates or exemption from certain taxes, and investment in
    charging infrastructure.

    <h3>Future</h3>
    <h4>Public perception</h4>

    <p>
      A European survey based on climate found that as of 2022, 39% of European
      citizens tend to prefer hybrid vehicles, 33% prefer petrol or diesel
      vehicles, followed by electric cars which were preferred by 28% of
      Europeans. 44% Chinese car buyers are the most likely to buy an electric
      car, while 38% of Americans would opt for a hybrid car, 33% would prefer
      petrol or diesel, while only 29% would go for an electric car. In a 2023
      survey concentrated specifically on electric car ownership in the US, 50%
      of respondents planning to purchase a future car considered themselves
      unlikely to seriously consider buying an EV. The survey also found that
      support for banning the production of non-electric vehicles in the US by
      2035 has declined from 47% to 40%.
    </p>

    <h4>Environmental considerations</h4>

    <p>
      By reducing types of air pollution, such as nitrogen dioxide, EVs could
      prevent hundreds of thousands of early deaths every year, especially from
      trucks and traffic in cities. The full environmental impact of electric
      vehicles includes the life cycle impacts of carbon and sulfur emissions,
      as well as toxic metals entering the environment. Rare-earth metals
      (neodymium, dysprosium) and other mined metals (copper, nickel, iron) are
      used by EV motors, while lithium, cobalt, manganese are used by the
      batteries. In 2023 the US State Department said that the supply of lithium
      would need to increase 42-fold by 2050 globally to support a transition to
      clean energy. Most of the lithium ion battery production occurs in China,
      where the bulk of energy used is supplied by coal burning power plants. A
      study of hundreds of cars on sale in 2021 concluded that the life cycle
      GHG emissions of full electric cars are slightly less than hybrids and
      that both are less than gasoline and diesel fuelled cars. An alternative
      method of sourcing essential battery materials being deliberated by the
      International Seabed Authority is deep sea mining, however carmakers are
      not using this as of 2023.
    </p>

    <h4>Improved batteries</h4>

    <p>
      Advances in lithium-ion batteries, driven at first by the personal-use
      electronics industry, allow full-sized, highway-capable EVs to travel
      nearly as far on a single charge as conventional cars go on a single tank
      of gasoline. Lithium batteries have been made safe, can be recharged in
      minutes instead of hours (see recharging time), and now last longer than
      the typical vehicle (see lifespan). The production cost of these lighter,
      higher-capacity lithium-ion batteries is gradually decreasing as the
      technology matures and production volumes increase. Research is also
      underway to improve battery reuse and recycling, which would further
      reduce the environmental impact of batteries. Many companies and
      researchers are also working on newer battery technologies, including
      solid state batteries and alternate technologies.
    </p>

    <h4>Battery management and intermediate storage</h4>

    <p>
      Another improvement is to decouple the electric motor from the battery
      through electronic control, using supercapacitors to buffer large but
      short power demands and regenerative braking energy.[144] The development
      of new cell types combined with intelligent cell management improved both
      weak points mentioned above. The cell management involves not only
      monitoring the health of the cells but also a redundant cell configuration
      (one more cell than needed). With sophisticated switched wiring, it is
      possible to condition one cell while the rest are on duty.
    </p>

    <h4>Electric trucks</h4>

    <p>
      An electric truck is a battery electric vehicle (BEV) designed to
      transport cargo, carry specialized payloads, or perform other utilitarian
      work. Electric trucks have serviced niche applications like milk floats,
      pushback tugs and forklifts for over a hundred years, typically using
      lead-acid batteries, but the rapid development of lighter and more
      energy-dense battery chemistries in the twenty-first century has broadened
      the range of applicability of electric propulsion to trucks in many more
      roles. Electric trucks reduce noise and pollution, relative to
      internal-combustion trucks. Due to the high efficiency and low
      component-counts of electric power trains, no fuel burning while idle, and
      silent and efficient acceleration, the costs of owning and operating
      electric trucks are dramatically lower than their predecessors. According
      to the United States Department of Energy, the average cost per kWh
      capacity of battery packs for trucks fell from $500 in 2013 to $200 in
      2019, and still further to $137 in 2020, with some vehicles under $100 for
      the first time. Long-distance freight has been the trucking segment least
      amenable to electrification, since the increased weight of batteries,
      relative to fuel, detracts from payload capacity, and the alternative,
      more frequent recharging, detracts from delivery time. By contrast,
      short-haul urban delivery has been electrified rapidly, since the clean
      and quiet nature of electric trucks fit well with urban planning and
      municipal regulation, and the capacities of reasonably sized batteries are
      well-suited to daily stop-and-go traffic within a metropolitan area. In
      South Korea, electric trucks hold a noticeable share of the new truck
      market; in 2020, among trucks produced and sold domestically (which are
      the vast majority of new trucks sold in the country), 7.6% were
      all-electric vehicles.
    </p>

    <h4>Hydrogen trains</h4>
    <p>
      Particularly in Europe, fuel-cell electric trains are gaining in
      popularity to replace diesel-electric units. In Germany, several Länder
      have ordered Alstom Coradia iLINT trainsets, in service since 2018, with
      France also planning to order trainsets. The United Kingdom, the
      Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Italy, Canada and Mexico are equally
      interested. In France, the SNCF plans to replace all its remaining
      diesel-electric trains with hydrogen trains by 2035. In the United
      Kingdom, Alstom announced in 2018 their plan to retrofit British Rail
      Class 321 trainsets with fuel cells.
    </p>

    <h4>Higher voltage outlets in garages of newly built homes</h4>

    <p>
      In New Mexico the government is looking to pass legislation mandating
      electrical receptacles that are higher voltage to be installed in garages
      of newly built homes.[158] The NEMA 14-50 outlets provide 240 volts and 50
      Amps for a total of 12.5 Kilowatts for level 2 charging of electric
      vehicles.[159][160] Level 2 charging can add up to 30 miles of range per
      hour of charging compared to up to 4 miles of range per hour for level 1
      charging from 120 volt outlets.
    </p>

    <h4>Bidirectional charging</h4>
    <p>
      General Motors (GM) is adding a capability called V2H, or bidirectional
      charging, to allow its new electric vehicles to send power from their
      batteries to the owner's home. GM will start with 2024 models, including
      the Silverado and Blazer EVs, and promises to continue the feature through
      to model year 2026. This could be helpful to the owner during unexpected
      power grid outages because an electric vehicle is a giant battery on
      wheels.
    </p>

    <h3>Infrastructure management</h3>

    <p>
      With the increase in number of electric vehicles, it is necessary to
      create an appropriate number of charging stations to supply the increasing
      demand, and a proper management system that coordinates the charging turn
      of each vehicle to avoid having some charging stations overloaded with
      vehicles and others empty.
    </p>

    <h4>Stabilization of the grid</h4>

    <p>
      Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charger where energy can flow back into the grid if
      needed Since EVs can be plugged into the electric grid when not in use,
      battery-powered vehicles could reduce the need for
      <strong>dispatchable generation</strong> by feeding electricity into the
      grid from their batteries during periods of high demand and low supply
      (such as just after sunset) while doing most of their charging at night or
      midday, when there is unused generating capacity. This vehicle-to-grid
      (V2G) connection has the potential to reduce the need for new power
      plants, as long as vehicle owners do not mind reducing the life of their
      batteries, by being drained by the power company during peak demand.
      Electric vehicle parking lots can provide
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle"
        >demand response</a
      >. Current electricity infrastructure may need to cope with increasing
      shares of variable-output power sources such as wind and solar. This
      variability could be addressed by adjusting the speed at which EV
      batteries are charged, or possibly even discharged. Some concepts see
      battery exchanges and battery charging stations, much like gas/petrol
      stations today. These will require enormous storage and charging
      potentials, which could be manipulated to vary the rate of charging, and
      to output power during shortage periods, much as diesel generators are
      used for short periods to stabilize some national grids.
    </p>

    <h4>Repair shops</h4>

    <p>
      The infrastructure for vehicle repairs after accidents is a concern for
      insurers and mechanics due to safety requirements. Batteries and other
      components must be carefully evaluated rather than being totally written
      off by insurers.
