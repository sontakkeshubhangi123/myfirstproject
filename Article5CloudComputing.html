    <p>
      Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing"
        >computer system resources</a
      >
      , especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without
      direct active management by the user. Large clouds often have functions
      distributed over multiple locations, each of which is a data center. Cloud
      computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and
      typically uses a pay-as-you-go model, which can help in reducing capital
      expenses but may also lead to unexpected
      <strong>operating expenses </strong> users.
    </p>

    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <hr />

    <p>
      A European Commission communication issued in 2012 argued that the breadth
      of scope offered by cloud computing made a general definition "elusive",
      although the United States National Institute of Standards and
      Technology's 2011 definition of cloud computing identified "five essential
      characteristics" On-demand self-service. A consumer can unilaterally
      provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage,
      as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each
      service provider. Broad network access. Capabilities are available over
      the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by
      heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones,
      tablets, laptops, and workstations). <strong>Resource pooling</strong>.
      The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers
      using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources
      dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. Rapid
      elasticity. Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in
      some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate
      with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning
      often appear unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any
      time. Measured service. Cloud systems automatically control and optimize
      resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of
      abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing,
      bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored,
      controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and
      consumer of the utilized service.
    </p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr />

    <p>
      Cloud computing has a rich history that extends back to the 1960s, with
      the initial concepts of time-sharing becoming popularized via
      <strong>remote job entry</strong> (RJE). The "data center" model, where
      users submitted jobs to operators to run on mainframes, was predominantly
      used during this era. This was a time of exploration and experimentation
      with ways to make large-scale computing power available to more users
      through time-sharing, optimizing the infrastructure, platform, and
      applications, and increasing efficiency for end users. The "cloud"
      metaphor for virtualized services dates to 1994, when it was used by
      General Magic for the universe of "places" that mobile agents in the
      Telescript environment could "go". The metaphor is credited to David
      Hoffman, a General Magic communications specialist, based on its
      long-standing use in networking and telecom. The expression cloud
      computing became more widely known in 1996 when
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">
        Compaq Computer Corporation </a
      >drew up a business plan for future computing and the Internet. The
      company's ambition was to supercharge sales with "cloud computing-enabled
      applications". The business plan foresaw that online consumer file storage
      would likely be commercially successful. As a result, Compaq decided to
      sell server hardware to <strong>internet service providers</strong>. In
      the 2000s, the application of cloud computing began to take shape with the
      establishment of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2002, which allowed
      developers to build applications independently. In 2006 the beta version
      of Google Docs was released, Amazon Simple Storage Service, known as
      Amazon S3, and the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), in 2008 NASA's
      development of the first open-source software for deploying private and
      hybrid clouds. The following decade saw the launch of various cloud
      services. In 2010, Microsoft launched Microsoft Azure, and Rackspace
      Hosting and NASA initiated an open-source cloud-software project,
      OpenStack. IBM introduced the IBM SmartCloud framework in 2011, and Oracle
      announced the Oracle Cloud in 2012. In December 2019, Amazon launched AWS
      Outposts, a service that extends AWS infrastructure, services, APIs, and
      tools to customer data centers, co-location spaces, or on-premises
      facilities. Since the global pandemic of 2020, cloud technology has surged
      in popularity due to the level of data security it offers and the
      flexibility of working options it provides for all employees, notably
      remote workers.
    </p>

    <h3>Value proposition</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Advocates of public and hybrid clouds claim that cloud computing allows
      companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs.
      Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their
      applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less
      maintenance, and that it enables IT teams to more rapidly adjust resources
      to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand, providing burst computing
      capability: high computing power at certain periods of peak demand.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges and limitations</h2>
    <hr />

    <p>
      One of the main challenges of cloud computing, in comparison to more
      traditional on-premises computing, is data security and privacy. Cloud
      users entrust their sensitive data to third-party providers, who may not
      have adequate measures to protect it from unauthorized access, breaches,
      or leaks. Cloud users also face compliance risks if they have to adhere to
      certain regulations or standards regarding data protection, such as
      <strong>GDPR </strong> HIPAA. Another challenge of cloud computing is
      reduced visibility and control. Cloud users may not have full insight into
      how their cloud resources are managed, configured, or optimized by their
      providers. They may also have limited ability to customize or modify their
      cloud services according to their specific needs or preferences. Complete
      understanding of all technology may be impossible, especially given the
      scale, complexity, and deliberate opacity of contemporary systems;
      however, there is a need for understanding complex technologies and their
      interconnections to have power and agency within them. The
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">metaphor</a> of
      the cloud can be seen as problematic as cloud computing retains the aura
      of something noumenal and numinous; it is something experienced without
      precisely understanding what it is or how it works. In addition, cloud
      migration is a significant issue. Cloud migration is the process of moving
      data, applications, or workloads from one cloud environment to another or
      from on-premises to the cloud. Cloud migration can be complex,
      time-consuming, and costly, especially if there are incompatibility issues
      between different cloud platforms or architectures. Cloud migration can
      also cause downtime, performance degradation, or data loss if not planned
      and executed properly.

    <h3>Security and privacy</h3>

    <p>
      Cloud computing poses privacy concerns because the service provider can
      access the data that is in the cloud at any time. It could accidentally or
      deliberately alter or delete information. Many cloud providers can share
      information with third parties if necessary for purposes of law and order
      without a warrant. That is permitted in their privacy policies, which
      users must agree to before they start using cloud services. Solutions to
      privacy include policy and legislation as well as end-users' choices for
      how data is stored. Users can encrypt data that is processed or stored
      within the cloud to prevent unauthorized access. Identity management
      systems can also provide practical solutions to privacy concerns in cloud
      computing. These systems distinguish between authorized and unauthorized
      users and determine the amount of data that is accessible to each entity.
      The systems work by creating and describing identities, recording
      activities, and getting rid of unused identities. According to the Cloud
      Security Alliance, the top three threats in the cloud are Insecure
      Interfaces and APIs, Data Loss & Leakage, and Hardware Failure—which
      accounted for 29%, 25% and 10% of all cloud security outages respectively.
      Together, these form shared technology vulnerabilities. In a cloud
      provider platform being shared by different users, there may be a
      possibility that information belonging to different customers resides on
      the same data server. Additionally, Eugene Schultz, chief technology
      officer at Emagined Security, said that hackers are spending substantial
      time and effort looking for ways to penetrate the cloud. "There are some
      real Achilles' heels in the cloud infrastructure that are making big holes
      for the bad guys to get into". Because data from hundreds or thousands of
      companies can be stored on large cloud servers, hackers can theoretically
      gain control of huge stores of information through a single attack—a
      process he called "hyperjacking". Some examples of this include the
      Dropbox security breach, and iCloud 2014 leak. Dropbox had been breached
      in October 2014, having over seven million of its users passwords stolen
      by hackers in an effort to get monetary value from it by Bitcoins (BTC).
      By having these passwords, they are able to read private data as well as
      have this data be indexed by search engines (making the information
      public). There is the problem of legal ownership of the data (If a user
      stores some data in the cloud, can the cloud provider profit from it?).
      Many Terms of Service agreements are silent on the question of ownership.
      Physical control of the computer equipment (private cloud) is more secure
      than having the equipment off-site and under someone else's control
      (public cloud). This delivers great incentive to public cloud computing
      service providers to prioritize building and maintaining strong management
      of secure services. Some small businesses that do not have expertise in IT
      security could find that it is more secure for them to use a public cloud.
      There is the risk that end users do not understand the issues involved
      when signing on to a cloud service (persons sometimes do not read the many
      pages of the terms of service agreement, and just click "Accept" without
      reading). This is important now that cloud computing is common and
      required for some services to work, for example for an intelligent
      personal assistant (Apple's Siri or Google Assistant). Fundamentally,
      private cloud is seen as more secure with higher levels of control for the
      owner, however public cloud is seen to be more flexible and requires less
      time and money investment from the user. The attacks that can be made on
      cloud computing systems include man-in-the middle attacks, phishing
      attacks, authentication attacks, and malware attacks. One of the largest
      threats is considered to be malware attacks, such as Trojan horses. Recent
      research conducted in 2022 has revealed that the Trojan horse injection
      method is a serious problem with harmful impacts on cloud computing
      systems.

    <h3>Service models</h3>
    <hr />

    <p>
      The
      <strong
        ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing"
          >service-oriented architecture
        </a></strong
      >(SOA) promotes the idea of "Everything as a Service" (EaaS or XaaS, or
      simply aAsS). This concept is operationalized in cloud computing through
      several service models as defined by the National Institute of Standards
      and Technology (NIST). The three standard service models are
      Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and
      Software as a Service (SaaS). They are commonly depicted as layers in a
      stack, providing different levels of abstraction. However, these layers
      are not necessarily interdependent. For instance, SaaS can be delivered on
      bare metal, bypassing PaaS and IaaS, and a program can run directly on
      IaaS without being packaged as SaaS.
    </p>

    <h3>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</h3>

    <p>
      Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) refers to online services that provide
      high-level APIs used to abstract various low-level details of underlying
      network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data
      partitioning, scaling, security, backup, etc. A hypervisor runs the
      virtual machines as guests. Pools of hypervisors within the cloud
      operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the
      ability to scale services up and down according to customers' varying
      requirements. Linux containers run in isolated partitions of a single
      Linux kernel running directly on the physical hardware. Linux cgroups and
      namespaces are the underlying Linux kernel technologies used to isolate,
      secure and manage the containers. The use of containers offers higher
      performance than virtualization because there is no hypervisor overhead.
      IaaS clouds often offer additional resources such as a virtual-machine
      disk-image library, raw block storage, file or object storage, firewalls,
      load balancers, IP addresses, virtual local area networks (VLANs), and
      software bundles. The NIST's definition of cloud computing describes IaaS
      as "where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which
      can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not
      manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over
      operating systems, storage, and deployed applications; and possibly
      limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls)."
      IaaS-cloud providers supply these resources on-demand from their large
      pools of equipment installed in data centers. For wide-area connectivity,
      customers can use either the Internet or carrier clouds (dedicated virtual
      private networks). To deploy their applications, cloud users install
      operating-system images and their application software on the cloud
      infrastructure. In this model, the cloud user patches and maintains the
      operating systems and the application software. Cloud providers typically
      bill IaaS services on a utility computing basis: cost reflects the number
      of resources allocated and consumed.
    </p>

    <h3>Platform as a service (PaaS)</h3>

    <p>
      The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud
      infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using
      programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the
      provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud
      infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage,
      but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration
      settings for the application-hosting environment. PaaS vendors offer a
      development environment to application developers. The provider typically
      develops toolkit and standards for development and channels for
      distribution and payment. In the PaaS models, cloud providers deliver a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing"
        >computing platform</a
      >
      , typically including an operating system, programming-language execution
      environment, database, and the web server. Application developers develop
      and run their software on a cloud platform instead of directly buying and
      managing the underlying hardware and software layers. With some PaaS, the
      underlying computer and storage resources scale automatically to match
      application demand so that the cloud user does not have to allocate
      resources manually.[need quotation to verify] Some integration and data
      management providers also use specialized applications of PaaS as delivery
      models for data. Examples include iPaaS (Integration Platform as a
      Service) and dPaaS (Data Platform as a Service). iPaaS enables customers
      to develop, execute and govern integration flows. Under the iPaaS
      integration model, customers drive the development and deployment of
      integrations without installing or managing any hardware or middleware.
      dPaaS delivers integration—and data-management—products as a fully managed
      service. Under the dPaaS model, the PaaS provider, not the customer,
      manages the development and execution of programs by building data
      applications for the customer. dPaaS users access data through
      data-visualization tools.
    </p>

    <h3>Software as a service (SaaS)</h3>

    <p>
      The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's
      applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are
      accessible from various client devices through either a thin client
      interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email), or a program
      interface. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud
      infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or
      even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of
      limited user-specific application configuration settings. In the software
      as a service (SaaS) model, users gain access to application software and
      databases. Cloud providers manage the infrastructure and platforms that
      run the applications. SaaS is sometimes referred to as "on-demand
      software" and is usually priced on a pay-per-use basis or using a
      subscription fee.[54] In the SaaS model, cloud providers install and
      operate application software in the cloud and cloud users access the
      software from cloud clients. Cloud users do not manage the cloud
      infrastructure and platform where the application runs. This eliminates
      the need to install and run the application on the cloud user's own
      computers, which simplifies maintenance and support. Cloud applications
      differ from other applications in their scalability—which can be achieved
      by cloning tasks onto multiple virtual machines at run-time to meet
      changing work demand.[55] Load balancers distribute the work over the set
      of virtual machines. This process is transparent to the cloud user, who
      sees only a single access-point. To accommodate a large number of cloud
      users, cloud applications can be multitenant, meaning that any machine may
      serve more than one cloud-user organization. The pricing model for SaaS
      applications is typically a monthly or yearly flat fee per user,[56] so
      prices become scalable and adjustable if users are added or removed at any
      point. It may also be free.[57] Proponents claim that SaaS gives a
      business the potential to reduce IT operational costs by outsourcing
      hardware and software maintenance and support to the cloud provider. This
      enables the business to reallocate IT operations costs away from
      hardware/software spending and from personnel expenses, towards meeting
      other goals. In addition, with applications hosted centrally, updates can
      be released without the need for users to install new software. One
      drawback of SaaS comes with storing the users' data on the cloud
      provider's server. As a result,[citation needed] there could be
      unauthorized access to the data.[58] Examples of applications offered as
      SaaS are games and productivity software like Google Docs and Office
      Online. SaaS applications may be integrated with cloud storage or File
      hosting services, which is the case with Google Docs being integrated with
      Google Drive, and Office Online being integrated with OneDrive.
    </p>

    <h3>Mobile "backend" as a service (MBaaS)</h3>

    <p>
      In the mobile "backend" as a service (m) model, also known as "backend as
      a service" (BaaS), web app and mobile app developers are provided with a
      way to link their applications to cloud storage and cloud computing
      services with application programming interfaces (APIs) exposed to their
      applications and custom software development kits (SDKs). Services include
      user management, push notifications, integration with social networking
      services and more. This is a relatively recent model in cloud computing,
      with most BaaS startups dating from 2011 or later but trends indicate that
      these services are gaining significant mainstream traction with enterprise
      consumers.
    </p>

    <h3>Serverless computing or Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)</h3>

    <p>
      Serverless computing is a cloud computing code execution model in which
      the cloud provider fully manages starting and stopping virtual machines as
      necessary to serve requests. Requests are billed by an abstract measure of
      the resources required to satisfy the request, rather than per virtual
      machine per hour. Despite the name, serverless computing does not actually
      involve running code without servers. The business or person using the
      system does not have to purchase, rent or provide servers or virtual
      machines for the back-end code to run on. Function as a service (FaaS) is
      a service-hosted remote procedure call that utilizes serverless computing
      to enable deploying individual functions in the cloud to run in response
      to events. Some consider FaaS to fall under the umbrella of serverless
      computing, while others use the terms interchangeably.
    </p>

    <h2>Deployment models</h2>
    <hr />

    <h3>Private</h3>

    <p>
      Private cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single
      organization, whether managed internally or by a third party, and hosted
      either internally or externally. Undertaking a private cloud project
      requires significant engagement to virtualize the business environment,
      and requires the organization to reevaluate decisions about existing
      resources. It can improve business, but every step in the project raises
      security issues that must be addressed to prevent serious vulnerabilities.
      Self-run <strong>data centers</strong> are generally capital intensive.
      They have a significant physical footprint, requiring allocations of
      space, hardware, and environmental controls. These assets have to be
      refreshed periodically, resulting in additional capital expenditures. They
      have attracted criticism because users "still have to buy, build, and
      manage them" and thus do not benefit from less hands-on management,
      essentially "[lacking] the economic model that makes cloud computing such
      an intriguing concept".
    </p>

    <h3>Public</h3>

    <p>
      Cloud services are considered "public" when they are delivered over the
      public Internet, and they may be offered as a paid subscription, or free
      of charge. Architecturally, there are few differences between public- and
      private-cloud services, but security concerns increase substantially when
      services (applications, storage, and other resources) are shared by
      multiple customers. Most public-cloud providers offer direct-connection
      services that allow customers to securely link their legacy data centers
      to their cloud-resident applications. Several factors like the
      functionality of the solutions, cost, integrational and organizational
      aspects as well as safety & security are influencing the decision of
      enterprises and organizations to choose a public cloud or on-premises
      solution.
    </p>

    <h3>Hybrid</h3>

    <p>
      Hybrid cloud is a composition of a public cloud and a private environment,
      such as a private cloud or on-premises resources, that remain distinct
      entities but are bound together, offering the benefits of multiple
      deployment models. Hybrid cloud can also mean the ability to connect
      collocation, managed and/or dedicated services with cloud resources.
      Gartner defines a hybrid cloud service as a cloud computing service that
      is composed of some combination of private, public and community cloud
      services, from different service providers. A hybrid cloud service crosses
      isolation and provider boundaries so that it cannot be simply put in one
      category of private, public, or community cloud service. It allows one to
      extend either the capacity or the capability of a cloud service, by
      aggregation, integration or customization with another cloud service.
      Varied use cases for hybrid cloud composition exist. For example, an
      organization may store sensitive client data in house on a private cloud
      application, but interconnect that application to a business intelligence
      application provided on a public cloud as a software service. This example
      of hybrid cloud extends the capabilities of the enterprise to deliver a
      specific business service through the addition of externally available
      public cloud services. Hybrid cloud adoption depends on a number of
      factors such as data security and compliance requirements, level of
      control needed over data, and the applications an organization uses.
      Another example of hybrid cloud is one where IT organizations use public
      cloud computing resources to meet temporary capacity needs that can not be
      met by the private cloud. This capability enables hybrid clouds to employ
      cloud bursting for scaling across clouds. Cloud bursting is an application
      deployment model in which an application runs in a private cloud or data
      center and "bursts" to a public cloud when the demand for computing
      capacity increases. A primary advantage of cloud bursting and a hybrid
      cloud model is that an organization pays for extra compute resources only
      when they are needed. Cloud bursting enables data centers to create an
      in-house IT infrastructure that supports average workloads, and use cloud
      resources from public or private clouds, during spikes in processing
      demands.
    </p>

    <h3>Others</h3>

    <h4>Community</h4>
    <p>
      Community cloud shares infrastructure between several organizations from a
      specific community with common concerns (security, compliance,
      jurisdiction, etc.), whether managed internally or by a third-party, and
      either hosted internally or externally. The costs are spread over fewer
      users than a public cloud (but more than a private cloud), so only some of
      the cost savings potential of cloud computing are realized.
    </p>

    <h4>Distributed</h4>
    <p>
      A cloud computing platform can be assembled from a distributed set of
      machines in different locations, connected to a single network or hub
      service. It is possible to distinguish between two types of distributed
      clouds: public-resource computing and volunteer cloud. Public-resource
      computing – This type of distributed cloud results from an expansive
      definition of cloud computing, because they are more akin to distributed
      computing than cloud computing. Nonetheless, it is considered a sub-class
      of cloud computing. Volunteer cloud – Volunteer cloud computing is
      characterized as the intersection of public-resource computing and cloud
      computing, where a cloud computing infrastructure is built using
      volunteered resources. Many challenges arise from this type of
      infrastructure, because of the volatility of the resources used to build
      it and the dynamic environment it operates in. It can also be called
      peer-to-peer clouds, or ad-hoc clouds. An interesting effort in such
      direction is Cloud@Home, it aims to implement a cloud computing
      infrastructure using volunteered resources providing a business-model to
      incentivize contributions through financial restitution.
    </p>

    <h4>Multi</h4>

    <p>
      Multicloud is the use of multiple cloud computing services in a single
      heterogeneous architecture to reduce reliance on single vendors, increase
      flexibility through choice, mitigate against disasters, etc. It differs
      from hybrid cloud in that it refers to multiple cloud services, rather
      than multiple deployment modes (public, private, legacy).
    </p>

    <h4>Poly</h4>
    <p>
      Poly cloud refers to the use of multiple public clouds for the purpose of
      leveraging specific services that each provider offers. It differs from
      Multi cloud in that it is not designed to increase flexibility or mitigate
      against failures but is rather used to allow an organization to achieve
      more than could be done with a single provider.
    </p>

    <h4>Big data</h4>
    <p>
      The issues of transferring large amounts of data to the cloud as well as
      data security once the data is in the cloud initially hampered adoption of
      cloud for big data, but now that much data originates in the cloud and
      with the advent of bare-metal servers, the cloud has become a solution for
      use cases including business analytics and geospatial analysis.
    </p>

    <h4>HPC</h4>
    <p>
      HPC cloud refers to the use of cloud computing services and infrastructure
      to execute high-performance computing (HPC) applications. These
      applications consume a considerable amount of computing power and memory
      and are traditionally executed on clusters of computers. In 2016 a handful
      of companies, including R-HPC, Amazon Web Services, Univa, Silicon
      Graphics International, Sabalcore, Gomput, and Penguin Computing offered a
      high-performance computing cloud. The Penguin On Demand (POD) cloud was
      one of the first non-virtualized remote HPC services offered on a
      pay-as-you-go basis. Penguin Computing launched its HPC cloud in 2016 as
      an alternative to Amazon's EC2 Elastic Compute Cloud, which uses
      virtualized computing nodes.

      involved in the delivery of cloud computing, typically involves multiple
      cloud components communicating with each other over a loose coupling

      intelligence in the use of tight or loose coupling as applied to
      mechanisms such as these and others.

    <p>
      Cloud engineering is the application of engineering disciplines of cloud
      computing. It brings a systematic approach to the high-level concerns of
      commercialization, standardization and governance in conceiving,
      developing, operating and maintaining cloud computing systems. It is a
      multidisciplinary method encompassing contributions from diverse areas

      to reach $1.3 trillion by 2025. While Gartner estimated that global public
      cloud services end-user spending would reach $600 billion by 2023. As per
      a McKinsey & Company report, cloud cost-optimization levers and
      value-oriented business use cases foresee more than $1 trillion in
      run-rate EBITDA across Fortune 500 companies as up for grabs in 2030. In
      2022, more than $1.3 trillion in enterprise IT spending was at stake from

    <h2>Similar concepts</h2>

    <p>
      The goal of cloud computing is to allow users to take benefit from all of
      these technologies, without the need for deep knowledge about or expertise
      with each one of them. The cloud aims to cut costs and helps the users
      focus on their core business instead of being impeded by IT obstacles. The
      main enabling technology for cloud computing is virtualization.
      Virtualization software separates a physical computing device into one or
      more "virtual" devices, each of which can be easily used and managed to
      perform computing tasks. With operating system–level virtualization
      essentially creating a scalable system of multiple independent computing
      devices, idle computing resources can be allocated and used more
      efficiently. Virtualization provides the agility required to speed up IT
      operations and reduces cost by increasing infrastructure utilization.
      Autonomic computing automates the process through which the user can
      provision resources on-demand. By minimizing user involvement, automation
      speeds up the process, reduces labor costs and reduces the possibility of
      human errors. Cloud computing uses concepts from utility computing to
      provide metrics for the services used. Cloud computing attempts to address
      QoS (quality of service) and reliability problems of other grid computing
      models. Cloud computing shares characteristics with:
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing"
        >Client–server model</a
      >
      – Client–server computing refers broadly to any distributed application
      that distinguishes between service providers (servers) and service
      requestors (clients).[102] Computer bureau – A service bureau providing
      computer services, particularly from the 1960s to 1980s. Grid computing –
      A form of distributed and parallel computing, whereby a 'super and virtual
      computer' is composed of a cluster of networked, loosely coupled computers
      acting in concert to perform very large tasks. Fog computing – Distributed
      computing paradigm that provides data, compute, storage and application
      services closer to the client or near-user edge devices, such as network
      routers. Furthermore, fog computing handles data at the network level, on
      smart devices and on the end-user client-side (e.g. mobile devices),
      instead of sending data to a remote location for processing. Utility
      computing – The "packaging of computing resources, such as computation and
      storage, as a metered service similar to a traditional public utility,
      such as electricity."[103][104] Peer-to-peer – A distributed architecture
      without the need for central coordination. Participants are both suppliers
      and consumers of resources (in contrast to the traditional client-server
      model). Cloud sandbox – A live, isolated computer environment in which a
      program, code or file can run without affecting the application in which
      it runs.

        <td>
          Public clouds deliver resources, such as compute, storage, network,
          develop-and-deploy environments, and applications over the internet.
          They are owned and run by third-party cloud service providers like
          Google Cloud.

        <td>Private cloud</td>
        <td>
          Private clouds are built, run, and used by a single organization,
          typically located on-premises. They provide greater control,
          customization, and data security but come with similar costs and
          resource limitations associated with traditional IT environments.

        <td>
          Environments that mix at least one private computing environment with
          one or more public clouds are called hybrid clouds. They allow youto
          leverage the resources and services from different computing
          environments and choose which is the most optimal for the workloads.
