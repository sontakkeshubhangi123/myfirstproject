    <p>
      Bitcoin (abbreviation: BTC; sign: ₿) is the first
      <strong>decentralized cryptocurrency</strong>. Nodes in the peer-to-peer
      bitcoin network verify transactions through cryptography and record them
      in a public distributed ledger, called a blockchain, without central
      oversight. Consensus between nodes is achieved using a computationally
      intensive process based on proof of work, called mining, that guarantees
      the security of the bitcoin blockchain. Mining consumes increasing
      quantities of electricity and has been criticized for its environmental
      effects. Based on a free market ideology, bitcoin was invented in 2008 by
      Satoshi Nakamoto, an unknown person.Use of bitcoin as a currency began in
      2009, with the release of its open-source implementation.In 2021,
      <strong>El Salvador </strong> it as legal tender.Bitcoin is currently used
      more as a store of value and less as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin"> medium of exchange</a> or unit of
      account. It is mostly seen as an investment and has been described by many
      scholars as an economic bubble. As bitcoin is pseudonymous, its use by
      criminals has attracted the attention of regulators, leading to its ban by
      several countries as of 2021.
    </p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr />

    <h3>Background</h3>

    <p>
      Before bitcoin, several<strong> digital cash technologies </strong>
      released, starting with David Chaum's ecash in the 1980s.The idea that
      solutions to computational puzzles could have some value was first
      proposed by cryptographers Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor in 1992. The
      concept was independently rediscovered by Adam Back who developed
      Hashcash, a proof-of-work scheme for spam control in 1997. The first
      proposals for distributed digital scarcity-based cryptocurrencies came
      from cypherpunks Wei Dai (b-money) and Nick Szabo (bit gold) in 1998. In
      2004, Hal Finney developed the first currency based on reusable proof of
      work. These various attempts were not successful: Chaum's concept required
      centralized control and no banks wanted to sign on, Hashcash had no
      protection against double-spending, while b-money and bit gold were not
      resistant to Sybil attacks.
    </p>

    <h3>2008–2009: Creation</h3>

    <p>
      The domain name bitcoin.org was registered on 18 August 2008. On 31
      October 2008, a link to a white paper authored by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Satoshi Nakamoto</a> titled
      Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was posted to a
      cryptography mailing list. Nakamoto implemented the bitcoin software as
      open-source code and released it in January 2009.Nakamoto's identity
      remains unknown.All individual components of bitcoin originated in earlier
      academic literature. Nakamoto's innovation was their complex interplay
      resulting in the first decentralized, Sybil resistant, Byzantine fault
      tolerant digital cash system, that would eventually be referred to as the
      first blockchain. Nakamoto's paper was not peer reviewed and was initially
      ignored by academics, who argued that it could not work. On 3 January
      2009, the bitcoin network was created when Nakamoto mined the starting
      block of the chain, known as the <strong>genesis block.</strong> Embedded
      in this block was the text "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of
      second bailout for banks", which is the date and headline of an issue of
      The Times newspaper. Nine days later, Hal Finney received the first
      bitcoin transaction: ten bitcoins from Nakamoto. Wei Dai and Nick Szabo
      were also early supporters. On May 22, 2010, the first known commercial
      transaction using bitcoin occurred when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought
      two Papa John's pizzas for ₿10,000, in what would later be celebrated as
      "Bitcoin Pizza Day".
    </p>

    <h3>2010–2012: Early growth</h3>
    <p>
      Blockchain analysts estimate that Nakamoto had mined about one million
      bitcoinsbefore disappearing in 2010 when he handed the network alert key
      and control of the code repository over to Gavin Andresen. Andresen later
      became lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation, an organization founded
      in September 2012 to promote bitcoin. After early "proof-of-concept"
      transactions, the first major users of bitcoin were black markets, such as
      the dark web Silk Road. During its 30 months of existence, beginning in
      February 2011, Silk Road exclusively accepted bitcoins as payment,
      transacting ₿9.9 million, worth about $214 million.
    </p>

    <h3>2013–2014: First regulatory actions</h3>
    <p>
      March 2013, the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)
      established regulatory guidelines for "decentralized virtual currencies"
      such as bitcoin, classifying American bitcoin miners who sell their
      generated bitcoins as money services businesses, subject to registration
      and other legal obligations. In May 2013, US authorities seized the
      unregistered exchange Mt. Gox. In June 2013, the US Drug Enforcement
      Administration seized ₿11.02 from a man attempting to use them to buy
      illegal substances. This marked the first time a government agency had
      seized bitcoins. The FBI seized about ₿30,000 in October 2013 from Silk
      Road, following the arrest of its founder Ross Ulbricht. In December 2013,
      the People's Bank of China prohibited Chinese financial institutions from
      using bitcoin. After the announcement, the value of bitcoin dropped, and
      Baidu no longer accepted bitcoins for certain services. Buying real-world
      goods with any virtual currency had been illegal in China since at least
      2009.
    </p>

    <h3>2015–2019</h3>
    <p>
      Research produced by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">University of Cambridge</a> estimated that in 2017,
      there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet,
      most of them using bitcoin. In August 2017, the SegWit software upgrade
      was activated. Segwit was intended to support the Lightning Network as
      well as improve scalability. SegWit opponents, who supported larger blocks
      as a scalability solution, forked to create Bitcoin Cash, one of many
      forks of bitcoin. In December 2017, the first futures on bitcoin was
      introduced by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). In February 2018, the
      price crashed after China imposed a complete ban on Bitcoin trading. The
      percentage of bitcoin trading in the Chinese renminbi fell from over 90%
      in September 2017 to less than 1% in June 2018. During the same year,
      Bitcoin prices were negatively affected by several hacks or thefts from
      cryptocurrency exchanges.
    </p>

    <h3>2020–present</h3>

    <p>
      2020, some major companies and institutions started to acquire bitcoin:
      MicroStrategy invested $250 million in bitcoin as a treasury reserve
      asset, Square, Inc., $50 million, and MassMutual, $100 million.In November
      2020, PayPal added support for bitcoin in the US. In February 2021,
      Bitcoin's market capitalization reached $1 trillion for the first time. In
      November 2021, the Taproot soft-fork upgrade was activated, adding support
      for Schnorr signatures, improved functionality of smart contracts and
      Lightning Network. Before, Bitcoin only used a custom elliptic curve with
      the ECDSA algorithm to produce signatures. In September 2021, Bitcoin
      became legal tender in El Salvador, alongside the US dollar. In October
      2021, the first bitcoin futures Exchange-traded fund (ETF), called BITO,
      from ProShares was approved by the SEC and listed on the CME. In May and
      June 2022, the bitcoin price fell following the collapses of TerraUSD, a
      stablecoin, and the Celsius Network, a cryptocurrency loan company. In
      2023, ordinals—non-fungible tokens (NFTs)—on Bitcoin, went live. In
      January 2024, the first 11 US spot bitcoin ETFs began trading, offering
      direct exposure to bitcoin for the first time on American stock exchanges.

    <h3>Units and divisibility</h3>
    <p>
      The unit of account of the bitcoin system is the bitcoin. It is most
      commonly represented with the symbol ₿ and the currency code BTC. However,
      the BTC code does not conform to ISO 4217 as BT is the country code of
      Bhutan, and ISO 4217 requires the first letter used in global commodities
      to be 'X'. XBT, a code that conforms to ISO 4217 though not officially
      part of it, is used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bloomberg</a> L.P. No uniform capitalization convention
      exists; some sources use Bitcoin, capitalized, to refer to the technology
      and network, and bitcoin, lowercase, for the unit of account. The
      Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary and the Oxford Advanced Learner's
      Dictionary use the capitalized and lowercase variants without distinction.
      One bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places.Units for smaller amounts
      of bitcoin are the millibitcoin (mBTC), equal to 1⁄1000 bitcoin, and the
      satoshi (sat), representing 1⁄100000000 (one hundred millionth) bitcoin,
      the smallest amount possible. 100,000 satoshis are one mBTC.
    </p>

    <h3>Blockchain</h3>

    <p>
      As a decentralized system, bitcoin operates without a central authority or
      single administrator, so that anyone can create a new bitcoin address and
      transact without needing any approval. This is accomplished through a
      specialized distributed ledger called a blockchain that records bitcoin
      transactions. The blockchain is implemented as an ordered list of blocks.
      Each block contains a SHA-256 hash of the previous block, chaining them in
      chronological order. The blockchain is maintained by a peer-to-peer
      network. Individual blocks, public addresses, and transactions within
      blocks are public information, and can be examined using a blockchain
      explorer. Nodes validate and broadcast transactions, each maintaining a
      copy of the blockchain for ownership verification. A new block is created
      every 10 minutes on average, updating the blockchain across all nodes
      without central oversight. This process tracks bitcoin spending, ensuring
      each bitcoin is spent only once. Unlike a traditional ledger that tracks
      physical currency, bitcoins exist digitally as unspent outputs of
      transactions.
    </p>

    <h3>Addresses and transactions</h3>

    <p>
      In the blockchain, bitcoins are linked to specific addresses that are
      hashes of a public key. Creating an address involves generating a random
      private key and then computing the corresponding address. This process is
      almost instant, but the reverse (finding the private key for a given
      address) is nearly impossible. Publishing a bitcoin address does not risk
      its private key, and it is extremely unlikely to accidentally generate a
      used key with funds. To use bitcoins, owners need their private key to
      digitally sign transactions, which are verified by the network using the
      public key, keeping the private key secret. Bitcoin transactions use a
      Forth-like scripting language, Involving one or more inputs and outputs.
      When sending bitcoins, a user specifies the recipients' addresses and the
      amount for each output. This allows sending bitcoins to several recipients
      in a single transaction. To prevent double-spending, each input must refer
      to a previous unspent output in the blockchain. Using multiple inputs is
      similar to using multiple coins in a cash transaction. As in a cash
      transaction, the sum of inputs can exceed the intended sum of payments. In
      such a case, an additional output can return the change back to the payer.
      Unallocated input satoshis in the transaction become the transaction fee.
      Losing a private key means losing access to the bitcoins, with no other
      proof of ownership accepted by the protocol. For instance, in 2013, a user
      lost ₿7,500, valued at US$7.5 million, by accidentally discarding a hard
      drive with the private key. It is estimated that around 20% of all
      bitcoins are lost. The private key must also be kept secret as its
      exposure, such as through a data breach, can lead to theft of the
      associated bitcoins. As of December 2017, approximately ₿980,000 had been
      stolen from cryptocurrency exchanges.
    </p>

    <h3>Mining</h3>

    <p>
      The mining process in Bitcoin involves maintaining the blockchain through
      computer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin"> processing power</a> . Miners group and broadcast new transactions
      into blocks, which are then verified by the network. Each block must
      contain a proof of work (PoW) to be accepted, involving finding a nonce
      number that, combined with the block content, produces a hash numerically
      smaller than the network's difficulty target. This PoW is simple to verify
      but hard to generate, requiring many attempts. PoW forms the basis of
      Bitcoin's consensus mechanism. The difficulty of generating a block is
      deterministically adjusted based on the mining power on the network by
      changing the difficulty target, which is recalibrated every 2,016 blocks
      (approximately two weeks) to maintain an average time of ten minutes
      between new blocks. The process requires significant computational power
      and specialized hardware. Miners who successfully find a new block can
      collect transaction fees from the included transactions and a set reward
      in bitcoins. To claim this reward, a special transaction called a coinbase
      is included in the block, with the miner as the payee. All bitcoins in
      existence have been created through this type of transaction. This reward
      is halved every 210,000 blocks until ₿21 million, with new bitcoin
      issuance slated to end around 2140. Afterward, miners will only earn from
      transaction fees. These fees are determined by the transaction's size and
      the amount of data stored, measured in satoshis per byte. The proof of
      work system and the chaining of blocks make blockchain modifications very
      difficult, as altering one block requires changing all subsequent blocks.
      As more blocks are added, modifying older blocks becomes increasingly
      challenging. In case of disagreement, nodes trust the longest chain, which
      required the greatest amount of effort to produce. To tamper or censor the
      ledger, one needs to control the majority of the global hashrate. The high
      cost required to reach this level of computational power guarantees the
      security of the bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin mining's environmental impact
      is controversial and has attracted the attention of regulators, leading to
      restrictions or incentives in various jurisdictions. As of 2022, a
      non-peer-reviewed study by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance
      (CCAF) estimated that bitcoin mining represented 0.4% of global
      electricity consumption. Another 2022 non-peer-reviewed commentary
      published in Joule estimated that bitcoin mining was responsible for 0.2%
      of world greenhouse gas emissions. About half of the electricity used is
      generated through fossil fuels. Moreover, mining hardware's short lifespan
      results in electronic waste. The amount of electrical energy consumed, and
      the e-waste generated, is comparable to that of Greece and the
      Netherlands, respectively.
    </p>

    <h3>Privacy and fungibility</h3>
    <p>
      is pseudonymous, with funds linked to addresses, not real-world
      identities. While the owners of these addresses are not directly
      identified, all transactions are public on the blockchain. Patterns of
      use, like spending coins from multiple inputs, can hint at a common owner.
      Public data can sometimes be matched with known address owners. Bitcoin
      exchanges might also need to collect personal data as per legal
      requirements. For enhanced privacy, users can generate a new address for
      each transaction. In the Bitcoin network, each bitcoin is treated equally,
      ensuring basic fungibility. However, users and applications can choose to
      differentiate between bitcoins. While wallets and software treat all
      bitcoins the same, each bitcoin's transaction history is recorded on the
      blockchain. This public record allows for chain analysis, where users can
      identify and potentially reject bitcoins from controversial sources. For
      example, in 2012, Mt. Gox froze accounts containing bitcoins identified as
      stolen.
    </p>

    <h3>Wallets</h3>

    <p>
      Bitcoin wallets were the first cryptocurrency wallets, enabling users to
      store the information necessary to transact bitcoins. glossary The first
      wallet program, simply named Bitcoin, and sometimes referred to as the
      Satoshi client, was released in 2009 by Nakamoto as open-source software.
      Bitcoin Core is among the best known clients. Forks of Bitcoin Core exist
      such as Bitcoin Unlimited. Wallets can be full clients, with a full copy
      of the blockchain to check the validity of mined blocks, or lightweight
      clients, just to send and receive transactions without a local copy of the
      entire blockchain. Third-party internet services called online wallets
      store users' credentials on their servers, making them susceptible of
      hacks. Cold storage protects bitcoins from such hacks by keeping private
      keys offline, either through specialized hardware wallets or paper
      printouts.
    </p>

    <h3>Scalability and decentralization challenges</h3>
    <p>
      Nakamoto limited the block size to one megabyte. The limited block size
      and frequency can lead to delayed processing of transactions, increased
      fees and a Bitcoin scalability problem. The
      <strong>Lightning Network, second-layer routing </strong>, is a potential
      scaling solution. Research shows a trend towards centralization in bitcoin
      as miners join pools for stable income.If a single miner or pool controls
      more than 50% of the hashing power, it would allow them to censor
      transactions and double-spend coins. In 2014, mining pool Ghash.io reached
      51% mining power, causing safety concerns, but later voluntarily capped
      its power at 39.99% for the benefit of the whole network. A few entities
      also dominate other parts of the ecosystem such as the client software,
      online wallets, and simplified payment verification (SPV) clients.

    <h3>Economics and usage</h3>
    <hr />
    <h4>Bitcoin's theoretical roots and ideology</h4>

    <p>
      According to the <strong>European Central Bank</strong>, the
      decentralization of money offered by bitcoin has its theoretical roots in
      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Austrian school of economics</a> , especially with Friedrich von Hayek's
      book The Denationalization of Money, in which he advocates a complete free
      market in the production, distribution and management of money to end the
      monopoly of central banks. Sociologist Nigel Dodd, citing the
      crypto-anarchist Declaration of Bitcoin's Independence, argues that the
      essence of the bitcoin ideology is to remove money from social, as well as
      governmental, control. The Economist describes bitcoin as "a
      techno-anarchist project to create an online version of cash, a way for
      people to transact without the possibility of interference from malicious
      governments or banks". These philosophical ideas initially attracted
      libertarians and anarchists. Economist Paul Krugman argues that
      cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are only used by bank skeptics and
      criminals.
    </p>

    <h4>Recognition as a currency and legal status</h4>

    <p>
      Money serves three purposes: a store of value, a medium of exchange, and a
      unit of account.According to The Economist in 2014, bitcoin functions best
      as a medium of exchange.[98] In 2015, The Economist noted that bitcoins
      had three qualities useful in a currency: they are "hard to earn, limited
      in supply and easy to verify". However, a 2018 assessment by The Economist
      stated that cryptocurrencies met none of these three criteria. Per some
      researchers, as of 2015, bitcoin functions more as a payment system than
      as a currency. In 2014, economist Robert J. Shiller wrote that bitcoin has
      potential as a unit of account for measuring the relative value of goods,
      as with Chile's Unidad de Fomento, but that "Bitcoin in its present form
      ... doesn't really solve any sensible economic problem". François R.
      Velde, Senior Economist at the Chicago Fed, described bitcoin as "an
      elegant solution to the problem of creating a digital currency". David
      Andolfatto, Vice President at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Federal Reserve Bank</a> of St. Louis,
      stated that bitcoin is a threat to the establishment, which he argues is a
      good thing for the Federal Reserve System and other central banks, because
      it prompts these institutions to operate sound policies. The legal status
      of bitcoin varies substantially from one jurisdiction to another. Because
      of its decentralized nature and its global presence, regulating bitcoin is
      difficult. However, the use of bitcoin can be criminalized, and shutting
      down exchanges and the peer-to-peer economy in a given country would
      constitute a de facto ban. The use of bitcoin by criminals has attracted
      the attention of financial regulators, legislative bodies, and law
      enforcement. Nobel-prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz says that
      bitcoin's anonymity encourages money laundering and other crimes.[105]
      This is the main justification behind bitcoin bans. As of November 2021,
      nine countries applied an absolute ban (Algeria, Bangladesh, China, Egypt,
      Iraq, Morocco, Nepal, Qatar, and Tunisia) while another 42 countries had
      an implicit ban. Bitcoin is only legal tender in El Salvador.
    </p>

    <h4>Use for payments</h4>

    As of 2018, Bitcoin is rarely used in transactions with merchants, but it is
    popular to <strong>purchase illegal goods online</strong>. Prices are not
    usually quoted in bitcoin and trades involve conversions into fiat
    currencies. Commonly cited reasons for not using Bitcoin include high costs,
    the inability to process chargebacks, high price volatility, long
    transaction times, and transaction fees (especially for small purchases).
    Bloomberg reported that bitcoin was being used for large-item purchases on
    the site Overstock.com and for cross-border payments to freelancers. As of
    2015, there was little sign of bitcoin use in international remittances
    despite high fees charged by banks and Western Union who compete in this
    market. In September 2021, the Bitcoin Law made bitcoin legal tender in El
    Salvador, alongside the US dollar. The adoption has been criticized both
    internationally and within El Salvador. In particular, in 2022, the
    International Monetary Fund (IMF) urged El Salvador to reverse its decision.
    As of 2022, the use of Bitcoin in El Salvador remains low: 80% of businesses
    refused to accept it despite being legally required to. In April 2022, the
    Central African Republic (CAR) adopted Bitcoin as legal tender alongside the
    CFA franc, but repealed the reform one year later. Bitcoin is also used by
    some governments. For instance, the Iranian government initially opposed
    cryptocurrencies, but later saw them as an opportunity to circumvent
    sanctions.[118] Since 2020, Iran has required local bitcoin miners to sell
    bitcoin to the Central Bank of Iran, allowing the central bank to use it for
    imports. Some constituent states also accept tax payments in bitcoin,
    including Colorado (US) and Zug (Switzerland). As of 2023, the US government
    owned more than $5 billion worth of seized bitcoin.

    <h4>Use for investment and status as an economic bubble</h4>

    <p>
      As of 2018, the overwhelming majority of bitcoin transactions took place
      on <strong>cryptocurrency exchanges</strong>.Since 2014, regulated bitcoin
      funds also allow exposure to the asset or to futures as an investment.
      Individuals and companies such as the Winklevoss twins and Elon Musk's
      companies SpaceX and Tesla have massively invested in Bitcoin. Bitcoin
      wealth is highly concentrated, with 0.01% holding 27% of in-circulation
      currency, as of 2021. As of September 2023, El Salvador had $76.5 million
      worth of bitcoin in its international reserves. In 2018, research
      published in the <strong>Journal of Monetary Economics</strong> concluded
      that price manipulation occurred during the Mt. Gox bitcoin theft and that
      the market remained vulnerable to manipulation. Research published in The
      Journal of Finance also suggested that trading associated with increases
      in the amount of the Tether cryptocurrency and associated trading at the
      Bitfinex exchange accounted for about half of the price increase in
      bitcoin in late 2017. Bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, has been
      described as an economic bubble by several economists, including Nobel
      Prize in Economics laureates, such as Joseph Stiglitz, James Heckman, and
      Paul Krugman. Another recipient of the prize, Robert Shiller, argues that
      bitcoin is rather a fad that may become an asset class. He describes its
      price growth as an "epidemic", driven by contagious narratives. According
      to research published in the
      <strong>International Review of Financial Analysis </strong> 2018, Bitcoin
      as an asset is highly volatile and does not behave like any other
      conventional asset. According to one 2022 analysis published in The
      Journal of Alternative Investments, bitcoin was less volatile than oil,
      silver, US Treasuries, and 190 stocks in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin"> S&P 500</a> during and after the
      2020 stock market crash. The term hodl was created in December 2013 for
      holding Bitcoin rather than selling it during periods of volatility.
      Economists, investors, and the central bank of Estonia have described
      bitcoin as a potential Ponzi scheme. Legal scholar Eric Posner disagrees,
      however, as "a real Ponzi scheme takes fraud; bitcoin, by contrast, seems
      more like a collective delusion". A 2014 World Bank report also concluded
      that bitcoin was not a deliberate Ponzi scheme.
