    <p>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a<strong>
        contagious disease
      </strong>
      by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The first known case was identified in
      Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Most scientists believe the SARS-CoV-2
      virus entered into human populations through natural zoonosis, similar to
      the SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV outbreaks, and consistent with other pandemics
      in human history. Social and environmental factors including
      <strong
        >climate change, natural ecosystem destruction and wildlife
        trade</strong
      >
      increased the likelihood of such zoonotic spillover. The disease quickly
      spread worldwide, resulting in the COVID-19 pandemic. The symptoms of
      COVID‑19 are variable but often include fever, fatigue, cough, breathing
      difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste. Symptoms may begin one to
      fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who
      are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Of those who develop
      symptoms noticeable enough to be classified as patients, most (81%)
      develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14%
      develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung
      involvement on imaging), and 5% develop critical symptoms (respiratory
      failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction). Older people are at a higher
      risk of developing severe symptoms. Some complications result in death.
      Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for
      months or years after infection, and damage to organs has been observed.
      Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term
      effects of the disease. COVID‑19 transmission occurs when infectious
      particles are breathed in or come into contact with the eyes, nose, or
      mouth. The risk is highest when people are in close proximity, but small
      airborne particles containing the virus can remain suspended in the air
      and travel over longer distances, particularly indoors. Transmission can
      also occur when people touch their eyes, nose or mouth after touching
      surfaces or objects that have been contaminated by the virus. People
      remain contagious for up to 20 days and can spread the virus even if they
      do not develop symptoms. Testing methods for COVID-19 to detect the
      virus's nucleic acid include real-time reverse transcription polymerase
      chain reaction (RT‑PCR),
      <strong
        >transcription-mediated amplification, and reverse transcription
        loop-mediated isothermal amplification</strong
      >
      (RT‑LAMP) from a nasopharyngeal swab. Several COVID-19 vaccines have been
      approved and distributed in various countries, many of which have
      initiated mass vaccination campaigns. Other preventive measures include
      physical or social distancing, quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces,
      use of face masks or coverings in public, covering coughs and sneezes,
      hand washing, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. While drugs
      have been developed to inhibit the virus, the primary treatment is still
      symptomatic, managing the disease through supportive care, isolation, and
      <strong>experimental measures</strong>.

      During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly
      referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus", with the disease
      sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia". In the past, many diseases have been
      named after geographical locations, such as the
      <strong>Spanish flu,Middle East respiratory syndrome</strong>, and Zika
      virus. In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended
      2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as interim names for the
      virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against
      using geographical locations or groups of people in disease and virus
      names to prevent social stigma. The official names COVID‑19 and SARS-CoV-2
      were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020 with COVID-19 being shorthand
      for "coronavirus disease 2019".The WHO additionally uses "the COVID‑19
      virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID‑19" in public communications.

    <h2>Symptoms and signs</h2>
    <hr />

    <p>
      The symptoms of COVID-19 are variable depending on the type of variant
      contracted, ranging from mild symptoms to a potentially fatal illness.
      Common symptoms include coughing, fever, loss of smell (anosmia) and taste
      (ageusia), with less common ones including
      <strong
        >headaches, nasal congestion and runny nose, muscle pain, sore throat,
        diarrhea, eye irritation</strong
      >, and toes swelling or turning purple,and in moderate to severe cases,
      breathing difficulties. People with the COVID-19 infection may have
      different symptoms, and their symptoms may change over time. Three common
      clusters of symptoms have been identified: one respiratory symptom cluster
      with cough, sputum, shortness of breath, and fever; a musculoskeletal
      symptom cluster with muscle and joint pain, headache, and fatigue; and a
      cluster of digestive symptoms with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.
      In people without prior ear, nose, or throat disorders, loss of taste
      combined with loss of smell is associated with COVID-19 and is reported in
      as many as 88% of symptomatic cases. Published data on the
      neuropathological changes related with COVID-19 have been limited and
      contentious, with neuropathological descriptions ranging from moderate to
      severe hemorrhagic and hypoxia phenotypes, thrombotic consequences,
      changes in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM-type), encephalitis
      and meningitis. Many COVID-19 patients with co-morbidities have hypoxia
      and have been in intensive care for varying lengths of time, confounding
      interpretation of the data. Of people who show symptoms, 81% develop only
      mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe
      symptoms (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19"
        >dyspnea, hypoxia</a
      >
      , or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging) that require
      hospitalization, and 5% of patients develop critical symptoms (respiratory
      failure, septic shock, or multiorgan dysfunction) requiring ICU admission.
      Proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection by age. About 44% of those
      infected with SARS-CoV-2 remained asymptomatic throughout the infection.
      At least a third of the people who are infected with the virus do not
      develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time. These asymptomatic
      carriers tend not to get tested and can still spread the disease.Other
      infected people will develop symptoms later (called "pre-symptomatic") or
      have very mild symptoms and can also spread the virus. As is common with
      infections, there is a delay between the moment a person first becomes
      infected and the appearance of the first symptoms. The median delay for
      COVID-19 is four to five days possibly being infectious on 1-4 of those
      days. Most symptomatic people experience symptoms within two to seven days
      after exposure, and almost all will experience at least one symptom within
      12 days. Most people recover from the acute phase of the disease. However,
      some people continue to experience a range of effects, such as fatigue,
      for months, even after recovery. This is the result of a condition called
      long COVID, which can be described as a range of persistent symptoms that
      continue for weeks or months at a time. Long-term damage to organs has
      also been observed after the onset of COVID-19. Multi-year studies are
      underway to further investigate the potential long-term effects of the
      disease. The Omicron variant became dominant in the U.S. in December 2021.
      Symptoms with the Omicron variant are less severe than they are with other
      variants.

    <h3>Complications</h3>

    <p>
      Complications may include
      <strong>pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome </strong>(ARDS),
      multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death. Cardiovascular complications
      may include heart failure, arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation),
      heart inflammation, and thrombosis, particularly venous thromboembolism.
      Approximately 20–30% of people who present with COVID‑19 have elevated
      liver enzymes, reflecting liver injury. Neurologic manifestations include
      seizure, stroke, encephalitis, and Guillain–Barré syndrome (which includes
      loss of motor functions). Following the infection, children may develop
      paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which has symptoms similar
      to Kawasaki disease, which can be fatal. In very rare cases, acute
      encephalopathy can occur, and it can be considered in those who have been
      diagnosed with COVID‑19 and have an altered mental status. According to
      the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pregnant women are at
      increased risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID‑19. This is because
      pregnant women with COVID‑19 appear to be more likely to develop
      respiratory and obstetric complications that can lead to miscarriage,
      premature delivery and intrauterine growth restriction. Fungal infections
      such as aspergillosis, candidiasis, cryptococcosis and mucormycosis have
      been recorded in patients recovering from COVID‑19
    </p>

    <h2>Cause</h2>
    <hr />

    <h3>Transmission</h3>

    <p>
      COVID-19 is mainly transmitted when people breathe in air contaminated by
      <strong>droplets/aerosols</strong> and small airborne particles containing
      the virus. Infected people exhale those particles as they breathe, talk,
      cough, sneeze, or sing. Transmission is more likely the closer people are.
      However, infection can occur over longer distances, particularly indoors.
      The transmission of the virus is carried out through virus-laden fluid
      particles, or droplets, which are created in the respiratory tract, and
      they are expelled by the mouth and the nose. There are three types of
      transmission: “droplet” and “contact”, which are associated with large
      droplets, and “airborne”, which is associated with small droplets.If the
      droplets are above a certain critical size, they settle faster than they
      evaporate, and therefore they contaminate surfaces surrounding them.
      Droplets that are below a certain critical size, evaporate faster than
      they settle; due to that fact, they form nuclei that remain airborne for a
      long period of time over extensive distances. Infectivity can begin four
      to five days before the onset of symptoms. Infected people can spread the
      disease even if they are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic. Most commonly,
      the peak viral load in upper respiratory tract samples occurs close to the
      time of symptom onset and declines after the first week after symptoms
      begin. Current evidence suggests a duration of viral shedding and the
      period of infectiousness of up to ten days following symptom onset for
      people with mild to moderate COVID-19, and up to 20 days for persons with
      severe COVID-19, including immunocompromised people. Infectious particles
      range in size from aerosols that remain suspended in the air for long
      periods of time to larger droplets that remain airborne briefly or fall to
      the ground. Additionally, COVID-19 research has redefined the traditional
      understanding of how respiratory viruses are transmitted. The largest
      droplets of respiratory fluid do not travel far, but can be inhaled or
      land on mucous membranes on the eyes, nose, or mouth to infect. Aerosols
      are highest in concentration when people are in close proximity, which
      leads to easier viral transmission when people are physically close, but
      airborne transmission can occur at longer distances, mainly in locations
      that are poorly ventilated; in those conditions small particles can remain
      suspended in the air for minutes to hours.
    </p>

    <h3>Virology</h3>

    <p>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from
      three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory
      illness cases in Wuhan. All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2
      virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature, particularly in
      <strong>Rhinolophus sinicus</strong> aka Chinese horseshoe bats. Outside
      the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap which bursts its
      protective bubble. Hospital disinfectants, alcohols, heat,
      povidone-iodine, and ultraviolet-C (UV-C) irradiation are also effective
      disinfection methods for surfaces. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the
      original SARS-CoV. It is thought to have an animal (zoonotic) origin.
      Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters
      with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B)
      together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the whole
      genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13). The
      structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include membrane glycoprotein (M),
      envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S).
      The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 is about 98% similar to the M protein of bat
      SARS-CoV, maintains around 98% homology with pangolin SARS-CoV, and has
      90% homology with the M protein of SARS-CoV; whereas, the similarity is
      only around 38% with the M protein of MERS-CoV.
    </p>

    <h3>SARS-CoV-2 variants</h3>

    <p>
      The many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into either clades
      or lineages. The WHO, in collaboration with partners, expert networks,
      national authorities, institutions and researchers, have established
      nomenclature systems for naming and tracking SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages
      by
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19">GISAID, Nextstrain</a>
      and Pango. The expert group convened by the WHO recommended the labelling
      of variants using letters of the Greek alphabet, for example, Alpha, Beta,
      Delta, and Gamma, giving the justification that they "will be easier and
      more practical to discussed by non-scientific audiences". Nextstrain
      divides the variants into five clades (19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, and 20C), while
      GISAID divides them into seven (L, O, V, S, G, GH, and GR). The Pango tool
      groups variants into lineages, with many circulating lineages being
      classed under the B.1 lineage. Several notable variants of SARS-CoV-2
      emerged throughout 2020. Cluster 5 emerged among minks and mink farmers in
      Denmark. After strict quarantines and a mink euthanasia campaign, the
      cluster was assessed to no longer be circulating among humans in Denmark
      as of 1 February 2021. As of December 2021, there are five dominant
      variants of SARS-CoV-2 spreading among global populations: the Alpha
      variant (B.1.1.7, formerly called the UK variant), first found in London
      and Kent, the Beta variant (B.1.351, formerly called the South Africa
      variant), the Gamma variant (P.1, formerly called the Brazil variant), the
      Delta variant (B.1.617.2, formerly called the India variant), and the
      Omicron variant (B.1.1.529), which had spread to 57 countries as of 7
      December. On December 19, 2023, the WHO declared that another distinctive
      variant, JN.1, had emerged as a "variant of interest". Though the WHO
      expected an increase in cases globally, particularly for countries
      entering winter, the overall global health risk was considered low.
    </p>

    <h2>Pathophysiology</h2>

    <p>
      The SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the
      body. COVID‑19 is most known for affecting the upper respiratory tract
      (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract (windpipe and
      lungs). The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID‑19 because the
      virus accesses host cells via the receptor for the enzyme
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant on the
      surface of type II alveolar cells of the lungs. The virus uses a special
      surface glycoprotein called a "spike" to connect to the ACE2 receptor and
      enter the host cell.
    </p>

    <h3>Respiratory tract</h3>
    <p>
      Following viral entry, COVID‑19 infects the ciliated epithelium of the
      nasopharynx and upper airways.[129] Autopsies of people who died of
      COVID‑19 have found diffuse alveolar damage, and lymphocyte-containing
      inflammatory infiltrates within the lung.
    </p>

    <h3>Nervous system</h3>
    <p>
      One common symptom, loss of smell, results from infection of the support
      cells of the olfactory epithelium, with subsequent damage to the olfactory
      neurons. The involvement of both the central and peripheral nervous system
      in COVID‑19 has been reported in many medical publications. It is clear
      that many people with
      <strong> COVID-19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues</strong>.
      The virus is not detected in the central nervous system (CNS) of the
      majority of COVID-19 patients with neurological issues. However,
      SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have
      died from COVID‑19, but these results need to be confirmed. While virus
      has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism
      by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion
      of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain. The virus
      may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood–brain
      barrier to gain access to the CNS, possibly within an infected white blood
      cell. Research conducted when Alpha was the dominant variant has suggested
      COVID-19 may cause brain damage. Later research showed that all variants
      studied (including Omicron) killed brain cells, but the exact cells killed
      varied by variant. It is unknown if such damage is temporary or permanent.
      Observed individuals infected with COVID-19 (most with mild cases)
      experienced an additional 0.2% to 2% of brain tissue lost in regions of
      the brain connected to the sense of smell compared with uninfected
      individuals, and the overall effect on the brain was equivalent on average
      to at least one extra year of normal ageing; infected individuals also
      scored lower on several cognitive tests. All effects were more pronounced
      among older ages.
    </p>

    <h3>Gastrointestinal tract</h3>
    The virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly
    expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelium
    as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.

    <h3>Pregnancy response</h3>
    <p>
      There are many unknowns for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic.
      Given that they are prone to have complications and severe disease
      infection with other types of coronaviruses, they have been identified as
      a vulnerable group and advised to take supplementary preventive measures.
      Physiological responses to pregnancy can include: Immunological: The
      immunological response to COVID-19, like other viruses, depends on a
      working immune system. It adapts during pregnancy to allow the development
      of the foetus whose genetic load is only partially shared with their
      mother, leading to a different immunological reaction to infections during
      the course of pregnancy. Respiratory: Many factors can make pregnant women
      more vulnerable to hard respiratory infections. One of them is the total
      reduction of the lungs' capacity and inability to clear secretions.
      Coagulation: During pregnancy, there are higher levels of circulating
      coagulation factors, and the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be
      implicated. The thromboembolic events with associated mortality are a risk
      for pregnant women. However, from the evidence base, it is difficult to
      conclude whether pregnant women are at increased risk of grave
      consequences of this virus. In addition to the above, other clinical
      studies have proved that SARS-CoV-2 can affect the period of pregnancy in
      different ways. On the one hand, there is little evidence of its impact up
      to 12 weeks gestation. On the other hand, COVID-19 infection may cause
      increased rates of unfavourable outcomes in the course of the pregnancy.
      Some examples of these could be foetal growth restriction, preterm birth,
      and perinatal mortality, which refers to the foetal death past 22 or 28
      completed weeks of pregnancy as well as the death among live-born children
      up to seven completed days of life. For preterm birth, a 2023 review
      indicates that there appears to be a correlation with COVID-19.
      Unvaccinated women in later stages of pregnancy with COVID-19 are more
      likely than other patients to need very intensive care. Babies born to
      mothers with COVID-19 are more likely to have breathing problems. Pregnant
      women are strongly encouraged to get
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19">vaccinated</a> .
    </p>

    <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
    <hr />

    <p>
      COVID‑19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and
      confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
      or other nucleic acid testing of infected secretions. Along with
      laboratory testing, chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in
      individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection. Detection of a
      past infection is possible with serological tests, which detect antibodies
      produced by the body in response to the infection.
    </p>

    <h3>Viral testing</h3>

    <p>
      The standard methods of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 are nucleic
      acid tests,[ which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments. As these
      tests detect RNA but not infectious virus, its "ability to determine
      duration of infectivity of patients is limited". The test is typically
      done on respiratory samples obtained by a
      <strong>nasopharyngeal swab</strong>; however, a nasal swab or sputum
      sample may also be used. Results are generally available within hours. The
      WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease. Several
      laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which detect
      antibodies produced by the body in response to infection. Several have
      been evaluated by Public Health England and approved for use in the UK.
      The University of Oxford's CEBM has pointed to mounting evidence that "a
      good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives after
      quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply
      clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has
      efficiently dealt with" and have called for "an international effort to
      standardize and periodically calibrate testing"In September 2020, the UK
      government issued "guidance for procedures to be implemented in
      laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results
      during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the
      predictive value of positive test results".
    </p>

    <h3>Imaging</h3>
    <p>
      Chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a
      high clinical suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine
      screening. Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral,
      asymmetric, and posterior distribution are common in early infection.
      Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal thickening with
      variable alveolar filling), and consolidation may appear as the disease
      progresses. Characteristic imaging features on chest radiographs and
      computed tomography (CT) of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric
      peripheral ground-glass opacities without pleural effusions. Many groups
      have created COVID‑19 datasets that include imagery such as the Italian
      Radiological Society which has compiled an international online database
      of imaging findings for confirmed cases.[190] Due to overlap with other
      infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by rRT-PCR is
      of limited specificity in identifying COVID‑19. A large study in China
      compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is
      less specific for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive.
    </p>

    <h3>Coding</h3>
    In late 2019, the WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for
    deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from
    clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID‑19 without lab-confirmed
    SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    <h3>Pathology</h3>
    <p>
      The main pathological findings at autopsy are:
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19"
        >Macroscopy: pericarditis, lung consolidation</a
      >
      and pulmonary oedema Lung findings: minor serous exudation, minor fibrin
      exudation pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical
      pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and
      multinucleated giant cell formation diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with
      diffuse alveolar exudates. DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress
      syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxaemia. organisation of exudates in
      alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis[130] plasmocytosis
      in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) Blood and vessels: disseminated

    <h2>Treatment</h2>
    <hr />

    <p>
      The treatment and management of COVID-19 combines both supportive care,
      which includes treatment to relieve symptoms, fluid therapy, oxygen
      support as needed, and a growing list of approved medications. Highly
      effective vaccines have reduced mortality related to SARS-CoV-2; however,
      for those awaiting vaccination, as well as for the estimated millions of
      immunocompromised persons who are unlikely to respond robustly to
      vaccination, treatment remains important. Some people may experience
      persistent symptoms or disability after recovery from the infection, known
      as long COVID, but there is still limited information on the best
      management and rehabilitation for this condition. Most cases of COVID-19
      are mild. In these, supportive care includes medication such as
      paracetamol or NSAIDs to relieve symptoms (fever, body aches, cough),
      proper intake of fluids, rest, and nasal breathing. Good personal hygiene
      and a healthy diet are also recommended. As of April 2020 the U.S. Centers
      for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that those who
      suspect they are carrying the virus isolate themselves at home and wear a
      face mask.As of November 2020 use of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone had
      been strongly recommended in those severe cases treated in hospital with
      low oxygen levels, to reduce the risk of death.Noninvasive ventilation
      and, ultimately, admission to an intensive care unit for mechanical
      ventilation may be required to support breathing. Extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its
      benefits are still under consideration. Some of the cases of severe
      disease course are caused by systemic hyper-inflammation, the so-called
      cytokine storm. Although several medications have been approved in
      different countries as of April 2022, not all countries have these
      medications. Patients with mild to moderate symptoms who are in the risk
      groups can take nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (marketed as Paxlovid) or
      remdesivir, either of which reduces the risk of serious illness or
      hospitalization.In the US, the Biden Administration COVID-19 action plan
      includes the Test to Treat initiative, where people can go to a pharmacy,
      take a COVID test, and immediately receive free Paxlovid if they test
      positive. Several experimental treatments are being actively studied in
      clinical trials. These include the antivirals molnupiravir (developed by
      Merck), and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (developed by Pfizer). Others were
      thought to be promising early in the pandemic, such as hydroxychloroquine
      and lopinavir/ritonavir, but later research found them to be ineffective
      or even harmful, like fluvoxamine, a cheap and widely available
      antidepressant; As of December 2020, there was not enough high-quality
      evidence to recommend so-called early treatment In December 2020, two
      monoclonal antibody-based therapies were available in the United States,
      for early use in cases thought to be at high risk of progression to severe
      disease. The antiviral remdesivir has been available in the U.S., Canada,
      Australia, and several other countries, with varying restrictions;
      however, it is not recommended for people needing mechanical ventilation,
      and has been discouraged altogether by the World Health Organization
      (WHO), due to limited evidence of its efficacy. In November 2021, the UK
      approved the use of molnupiravir as a COVID treatment for vulnerable
      patients recently diagnosed with the disease.
    </p>

    <h2>Prognosis and risk factors</h2>
    <hr />

    <p>
      The severity of COVID‑19 varies. The disease may take a mild course with
      few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases
      such as the <strong>common cold</strong>. In 3–4% of cases (7.4% for those
      over age 65) symptoms are severe enough to cause hospitalisation. Mild
      cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or
      critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover. Among those who
      have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to
      eight weeks. The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that the
      median time between the onset of symptoms and death was twelve days, with
      seven being hospitalised. However, people transferred to an ICU had a
      median time of ten days between hospitalisation and death Abnormal sodium
      levels during hospitalisation with COVID-19 are associated with poor
      prognoses: high sodium with a greater risk of death, and low sodium with
      an increased chance of needing ventilator support. Prolonged prothrombin
      time and elevated C-reactive protein levels on admission to the hospital
      are associated with severe course of COVID‑19 and with a transfer to ICU.
      Some early studies suggest 10% to 20% of people with COVID‑19 will
      experience symptoms lasting longer than a month. A majority of those who
      were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems
      including fatigue and shortness of breath. On 30 October 2020, WHO chief
      Tedros Adhanom warned that "to a significant number of people, the COVID
      virus poses a range of serious long-term effects". He has described the
      vast spectrum of COVID‑19 symptoms that fluctuate over time as "really
      concerning". They range from fatigue, a cough and shortness of breath, to
      inflammation and injury of major organs – including the lungs and heart,
      and also neurological and psychologic effects. Symptoms often overlap and
      can affect any system in the body. Infected people have reported cyclical
      bouts of fatigue, headaches, months of complete exhaustion, mood swings,
      and other symptoms. Tedros therefore concluded that a strategy of
      achieving herd immunity by infection, rather than vaccination, is "morally
      unconscionable and unfeasible". In terms of hospital readmissions about 9%
      of 106,000 individuals had to return for hospital treatment within two
      months of discharge. The average to readmit was eight days since first
      hospital visit. There are several risk factors that have been identified
      as being a cause of multiple admissions to a hospital facility. Among
      these are advanced age (above 65 years of age) and presence of a chronic
      condition such as diabetes, COPD, heart failure or chronic kidney disease.
      According to scientific reviews smokers are more likely to require
      intensive care or die compared to non-smokers. Acting on the same ACE2
      pulmonary receptors affected by smoking, air pollution has been correlated
      with the disease. Short-term and chronic exposure to air pollution seems
      to enhance morbidity and mortality from COVID‑19. Pre-existing heart and
      lung diseases and also obesity, especially in conjunction with fatty liver
      disease, contributes to an increased health risk of COVID‑19. It is also
      assumed that those that are immunocompromised are at higher risk of
      getting severely sick from SARS-CoV-2. One research study that looked into
      the COVID‑19 infections in hospitalised kidney transplant recipients found
      a mortality rate of 11% Men with untreated hypogonadism were 2.4 times
      more likely than men with eugonadism to be hospitalised if they contracted
      COVID-19; Hypogonad men treated with testosterone were less likely to be
      hospitalised for COVID-19 than men who were not treated for hypogonadism.

    <h3>Children</h3>

    <p>
      While very young children have experienced lower rates of infection, older
      children have a rate of infection that is similar to the population as a
      whole. Children are likely to have milder symptoms and are at lower risk
      of severe disease than adults.The CDC reports that in the US roughly a
      third of hospitalised children were admitted to the ICU, while a European
      multinational study of hospitalised children from June 2020, found that
      about 8% of children admitted to a hospital needed intensive care. Four of
      the 582 children (0.7%) in the European study died, but the actual
      mortality rate may be "substantially lower" since milder cases that did
      not seek medical help were not included in the study.
    </p>

    <h3>Long-term effects</h3>

    <p>
      Around 10% to 30% of non-hospitalised people with COVID-19 go on to
      develop long COVID. For those that do need hospitalisation, the incidence
      of long-term effects is over 50%. Long COVID is an often severe
      multisystem disease with a large set of symptoms. There are likely
      various, possibly coinciding, causes. Organ damage from the acute
      infection can explain a part of the symptoms, but long COVID is also
      observed in people where organ damage seems to be absent. By a variety of
      mechanisms, the lungs are the organs most affected in COVID‑19. In people
      requiring hospital admission, up to 98% of CT scans performed show lung
      abnormalities after 28 days of illness even if they had clinically
      improved.People with advanced age, severe disease, prolonged ICU stays, or
      who smoke are more likely to have long-lasting effects, including
      pulmonary fibrosis.[336] Overall, approximately one-third of those
      investigated after four weeks will have findings of pulmonary fibrosis or
      reduced lung function as measured by DLCO, even in asymptomatic people,
      but with the suggestion of continuing improvement with the passing of more
      time. After severe disease, lung function can take anywhere from three
      months to a year or more to return to previous levels. The risks of
      <strong>cognitive deficit, </strong>, psychotic disorders, and epilepsy or
      seizures persists at an increased level two years after infection.

    <h3>History</h3>
    <hr />

    <p>
      The virus is thought to be of natural animal origin, most likely through
      spillover infection. A joint-study conducted in early 2021 by the People's
      Republic of China and the World Health Organization indicated that the
      virus descended from a coronavirus that infects wild bats, and likely
      spread to humans through an intermediary wildlife host. There are several
      theories about where the index case originated and
      <strong>investigations into the origin of the pandemic </strong> ongoing.
      According to articles published in July 2022 in Science, virus
      transmission into humans occurred through two spillover events in November
      2019 and was likely due to live wildlife trade on the Huanan wet market in
      the city of Wuhan (Hubei, China). Doubts about the conclusions have mostly
      centered on the precise site of spillover. Earlier phylogenetics estimated
      that SARS-CoV-2 arose in October or November 2019. A phylogenetic
      algorithm analysis suggested that the virus may have been circulating in
      Guangdong before Wuhan. Most scientists believe the virus spilled into
      human populations through natural zoonosis, similar to the SARS-CoV-1 and
      MERS-CoV outbreaks, and consistent with other pandemics in human history.
      According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change several social
      and environmental factors including climate change, natural ecosystem
      destruction and wildlife trade increased the likelihood of such zoonotic
      spillover. One study made with the support of the European Union found
      climate change increased the likelihood of the pandemic by influencing
      distribution of bat species. Available evidence suggests that the
      SARS-CoV-2 virus was originally harboured by bats, and spread to humans
      multiple times from infected wild animals at the Huanan Seafood Market in
      Wuhan in December 2019. A minority of scientists and some members of the
      U.S intelligence community believe the virus may have been unintentionally
      leaked from a laboratory such as the Wuhan Institute of Virology.The US
      intelligence community has mixed views on the issue, but overall agrees
      with the scientific consensus that the virus was not developed as a
      biological weapon and is unlikely to have been genetically engineered.
      There is no evidence SARS-CoV-2 existed in any laboratory prior to the
      pandemic.

    <h4>Research</h4>
    <hr />

    <p>
      International research on vaccines and medicines in COVID‑19 is underway
      by government organisations, academic groups, and industry researchers.The
      CDC has classified it to require a BSL3 grade laboratory. There has been a
      great deal of COVID‑19 research, involving accelerated research processes
      and publishing shortcuts to meet the global demand. As of December 2020,
      hundreds of clinical trials have been undertaken, with research happening
      on every continent except Antarctica. As of November 2020, more than 200
      possible treatments have been studied in humans.
    </p>

    <h5>Transmission and prevention research</h5>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19">Modelling</a> research
      has been conducted with several objectives, including predictions of the
      dynamics of transmission, diagnosis and prognosis of infection, estimation
      of the impact of interventions or allocation of resources. Modelling
      studies are mostly based on compartmental models in epidemiology,
      estimating the number of infected people over time under given conditions.
      Several other types of models have been developed and used during the
      COVID‑19 pandemic including computational fluid dynamics models to study
      the flow physics of COVID‑19, retrofits of crowd movement models to study
      occupant exposure, mobility-data based models to investigate transmission,
      or the use of macroeconomic models to assess the economic impact of the
      pandemic.
    </p>

    <h5>Treatment-related research</h5>

    <p>
      Seven possible drug targets in viral replication process and drugs
      Repurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the research into COVID‑19
      treatments. Other candidates in trials include vasodilators,
      corticosteroids, immune therapies, lipoic acid, bevacizumab, and
      recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. In March 2020, the
      <strong>World Health Organization</strong> (WHO) initiated the Solidarity
      trial to assess the treatment effects of some promising drugs: an
      experimental drug called remdesivir; anti-malarial drugs chloroquine and
      hydroxychloroquine; two anti-HIV drugs, lopinavir/ritonavir; and
      interferon-beta. More than 300 active clinical trials are underway as of
      April 2020. Research on the antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and
      chloroquine showed that they were ineffective at best, and that they may
      reduce the antiviral activity of remdesivir. By May 2020, France, Italy,
      and Belgium had banned the use of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID‑19
      treatment. In June, initial results from the randomised RECOVERY Trial in
      the United Kingdom showed that dexamethasone reduced mortality by one
      third for people who are critically ill on ventilators and one fifth for
      those receiving supplemental oxygen.Because this is a well-tested and
      widely available treatment, it was welcomed by the WHO, which is in the
      process of updating treatment guidelines to include dexamethasone and
      other steroids. Based on those preliminary results, dexamethasone
      treatment has been recommended by the NIH for patients with COVID‑19 who
      are mechanically ventilated or who require supplemental oxygen but not in
      patients with COVID‑19 who do not require supplemental oxygen. In
      September 2020, the WHO released updated guidance on using corticosteroids
      for COVID‑19. The WHO recommends systemic corticosteroids rather than no
      systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of people with severe and
      critical COVID‑19 (strong recommendation, based on moderate certainty
      evidence). The WHO suggests not to use corticosteroids in the treatment of
      people with non-severe COVID‑19 (conditional recommendation, based on low
      certainty evidence). The updated guidance was based on a meta-analysis of
      clinical trials of critically ill COVID‑19 patients. In September 2020,
      the European Medicines Agency (EMA) endorsed the use of dexamethasone in
      adults and adolescents from twelve years of age and weighing at least 40
      kilograms (88 lb) who require supplemental oxygen therapy. Dexamethasone
      can be taken by mouth or given as an injection or infusion (drip) into a
      vein. In November 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued
      an emergency use authorisation for the investigational monoclonal antibody
      therapy bamlanivimab for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID‑19.
      Bamlanivimab is authorised for people with positive results of direct
      SARS-CoV-2 viral testing who are twelve years of age and older weighing at
      least 40 kilograms (88 lb), and who are at high risk for progressing to
      severe COVID‑19 or hospitalisation.This includes those who are 65 years of
      age or older, or who have chronic medical conditions. In February 2021,
      the FDA issued an emergency use authorisation (EUA) for bamlanivimab and
      etesevimab administered together for the treatment of mild to moderate
      COVID‑19 in people twelve years of age or older weighing at least 40
      kilograms (88 lb) who test positive for SARS‑CoV‑2 and who are at high
      risk for progressing to severe COVID‑19. The authorised use includes
      treatment for those who are 65 years of age or older or who have certain
      chronic medical conditions. In April 2021, the FDA revoked the emergency
      use authorisation (EUA) that allowed for the investigational monoclonal
      antibody therapy bamlanivimab, when administered alone, to be used for the
      treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID‑19 in adults and certain paediatric
      patients.

    <h5>Bioethics</h5>
    <p>
      Since the outbreak of the COVID‑19 pandemic, scholars have explored the
      <strong>bioethics, normative economics</strong>, and political theories of
      healthcare policies related to the public health crisis. Academics have
      pointed to the moral distress of healthcare workers, ethics of
      distributing scarce healthcare resources such as ventilators, and the
      global justice of vaccine diplomacies.[citation needed] The socio-economic
      inequalities between genders, races, groups with disabilities,communities,
      regions, countries, and continents have also drawn attention in academia
      and the general public.
