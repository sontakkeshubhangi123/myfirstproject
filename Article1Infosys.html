    <h4>Controversies</h4>

    <h5>Settlement of tax fraud in the US</h5>

    <p>
      In December 2019, the Attorney General of California,
      <strong>Xavier Becerra</strong> announced an $800,000 settlement against
      Infosys and its BPM (business process management) subsidiary. Close to 500
      Infosys employees were working in the state on Infosys-sponsored B-1 visas
      instead of H-1B visas between 2006 and 2017, as per an official post
      available on the website of State of California. This misclassification
      resulted in Infosys avoiding California payroll taxes such as unemployment
      insurance, disability insurance, and employment training taxes.

    <h5>Accusation of visa fraud in the US</h5>
    <p>
      In 2011, Infosys was accused of committing visa fraud by using B-1
      (visitor) visas for work requiring H-1B (work) visas. The allegations were
      initially made by an American employee of Infosys in an internal
      complaint. He subsequently sued the company, claiming that he was harassed
      and sidelined after speaking out. Although that case was dismissed it,
      along with another similar case,brought the allegations to the notice of
      the US authorities – and the

      >and a federal grand jury started investigating. In October 2013, Infosys
      agreed to settle the civil suit with US authorities by paying US$34
      million. Infosys refused to admit guilt and stressed that it only agreed
      to pay the fine to avoid the nuisance of "prolonged litigation". In its
      statement, the company said "As reflected in the settlement, Infosys
      denies and disputes any claims of systemic visa fraud, misuse of visas for
      competitive advantage, or immigration abuse. Those claims are assertions
      that remain unproven".

    <h5>Malfunctioning income tax, GST and MCA portal</h5>
    <p>
      From 2016 onwards, after Infosys took over the contract from Tata
      Consultancy Services stakeholders complained about malfunctioning and low
      performance of portals multiple times. The Income Tax portal went down on
      the due date of multiple tax periods and taxpayers ended up paying late
      fees and penalties, and the government allowed the extension of due dates
      because of this.

      <strong>Chartered accountants and Company secretaries </strong> issues
      with MCA portal on due dates. Many companies became liable for additional
      fees and fines due to non-compliance. This issue is turning opposite to
      Ease of doing business initiatives of Government of India.

      <strong>
        CAs and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosys">Tax professionals</a>
      </strong>
      concerns about the flawed GST portal and their inability to rectify these
      issues. Government faced severe criticism from CAs, CSs and other
      stakeholders for its continuous failure to take action against Infosys and
      alleged that public fund is being heavily mis-utilised.
